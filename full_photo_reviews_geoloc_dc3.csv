When I said this was the case and that I was concerned about bed bugs, he said it would be looked into. I submitted photographs of the bites and I received an email from the hotel manager a few days later saying the room had been inspected and there were no bed bugs.The very painful bites gradually cleared up after leaving the hotel so I cannot think of any other explanation. When I searched on the internet after staying I found there were many other guests who had reported the same problem. Hotel management did not have the courtesy to respond to my further emails and phone calls."

I chose this hotel for the good rate and was pleasantly surprised. Although our room (King bed) was small that can be expected in any large city. It came with a good-sized mini-frig, microwave and coffee pot. The bathroom was small but adequate. Probably could use a bit up updating, but I was fine with it. The bed was a King and very comfortable. The AC worked great, but a bit noisy as all those types of units are. I just kept the fan on continuously and you get used to it. I really appreciated how well it worked since it was so hot and humid outside.The breakfast is included in the price and includes all the typical American fare--bread, bagels, cereal, yogurt, waffle maker and the likes. I eat grain free so its always a challenge to eat out, but there were scrambled eggs and sausage available, as well as some hard boiled eggs in the refrigerator with the yogurt. I wish they would put out hard boiled eggs in the shell (real eggs). The pre-peeled eggs have that weird flavor to them. There was also fresh fruit such as whole bananas and apples. Of course, hot coffee and tea. There were several big groups staying at the hotel and they seemed to be picked up by their bus at 8am, so I would suggest either eating close to 7am or waiting till after 8am. Even with the large groups dining, they moved right along so not much of a wait. The location was good for us. Just a few blocks over and there were some nice restaurants. One block away is a nice market filled with whatever you need. There are usually taxis parked out front. We did take one to Adams Morgan but he needed our help finding it! From then on we took an Uber. No problems there. They just go where their phones tell them to go. There is free wifi, but it works sporadically. I would stay here again if we visit our daughter!"

I know they're trying to appeal to the business man/woman by putting a desk in the room, but honestly it's just too much furniture for such a small room. Besides, there no outlet to plug in any device anywhere near the desk, so unless your laptop or device is fully charged, it's useless, not to mention the chair is in the way should your companion need to use the bathroom while tour sitting at it. An outlet by the room door, and between the beds on the night stand and that was it. The one on the nightstand was convenient as it had two outlets, plus two USB ports for charging devices. Refrigerator started to freeze contents after they had been in there a while, but the setting knob was all the way up. So if you use it, I'd suggest a setting of 4/5 and not 6. No freezer in that fridge by the way.No microwave in room. Something I take for granted everywhere else. And should have noticed in missing from the room description. But that meant the microwave meals I brought to save eating out all the time were a wasted effort and just meant there was something else to haul back to the car when leaving.Bathroom like the room itself was small, but again, did it's job. Tub and some towels could have been cleaner though.Staff was friendly and even helped me out when I realized I had forgotten my shave cream at home. Something ALL other places I've stayed at would have gladly over charged me for, so a big thanks on that one.Room faced 13th street and there seemed to be an emergency vehicle going down the road every half hour/ hour so prepare for that. I'm sure it's one of the main roads used around that area. Maybe it was because it was a weekend, but the noise can be a bit bothersome when trying to sleep. We didn't get mad, as we figured it's a big city and your going to have a lot of noise when in a big city. I'm sure unless your off a main road your going to hear that regardless of where you stay in DC though. But maybe ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. They do offer ear plugs.Breakfast room wasn't bad. Good selection of drinks/juices. The typical breakfast cereals and muffins. Toaster with slices of bread and bagels. Waffle maker is real popular of course. Only complaint there would be that the sausage and eggs were not kept hot enough. I don't think there was any means of keeping them warm and they both would have been great if they had been. Pretty sure that's a big risk letting them sit out and get cold like that. Something management needs to look into before someone gets ill.I luckily found on street parking not but a block away, so that saved on the valet service, which would have cost me $70+ for the weekend, but that is what I called a miracle at the time. Finding parking in DC that you can leave a car in for two days is rare. I got lucky and it was the weekend, but I had to leave the hotel earlier than I wanted because of the restrictions on that parking space. I would NOT count on that happening to you. I would have used Valet parking actually and was quit prepared for the cost, BUT after circling the block a dozen times (and that's no joke or over exaggeration there) I could not get a spot in front of the hotel to use valet parking. I was about to call the desk to ask how the heck does one park for the valet when every time I pass the front of the building that spot is taken. Very frustrating to say the least and I was starting to regret I chose this place when circling the building over and over. So I'd prepare for that on busy parts of the day.Most reviews said it was within a 10 to 15 minute walking distance to the White House, but I'd say it's closer to 20/25 unless your young and can walk fast. Walking back from that area is also an uphill walk, so be prepared for that. Nothing real steep and not all the way, but it would make a difference to someone with disabilities or out of shape. There are some places to eat within walking distance. Most places we ate at were within a five to ten minute walk."

He not only booked the additional night for us, but he honored the Booking.com rate and we were able to stay in the same room. The hotel is located in a former apartment building and has a historical designation. The rooms are small but adequate. The entire building and our room was extremely clean. The complimentary hot breakfast was very good and was served in a comfortable updated room. They offer complimentary coffee, tea, hot chocolate and lemon water in the lobby. I will definitely stay here again when in DC."

I was put in a room tucked back in a small hall to the left of the check in desk. It was right on the street so I did get some street noise as well as noise from people checking in/out. The room was tiny but I don't expect much of lower priced city hotels. I happened to be in the lobby a few times when the same person on another floor came down repeatedly complaining of bugs. She had a dead one in her bed and then moved rooms and apparently had another issue in another room. The next morning I woke up to 11 bites to my face and body. I did show the person at the front desk and he apologized but didn't offer to do anything about it. I applied cortisone & antibiotic ointment but the bites took a full 2 weeks to go away. Makeup couldn't even hide them because of the swelling & because I was traveling for work, I didn't have time to seek medical attention which was quite embarrassing to explain to people. While the location of this hotel is good & I am a Choice Privileges member, I would stay elsewhere based on my experience. I have attached photos to my review."

There was also a selection of bread, muffins, cereal, fruit, etc. There were also waffle makers. The location is good, convenient to the convention center. The TV was good and the selection of channels was very good. There is an in-room safe, which is important to me. The bathroom was clean and the towels were soft. My room overlooked the street and was very quiet. The location is good, about 5 blocks to the convention center, 3/4 mile to the White House and about 1.5 mile to the Mall.The wi-fi in 409 was very slow when I checked in, about 7.30 PM. It was better but still slow at 5 AM the next day. However, it was usable to read the news and do emails. As some have mentioned the room was small but that wasn't really an issue for me - this is more an FYI. FWIW, after my stay I booked this hotel for a 4 day convention I will be attending in spring 2017. In other words, I'll stay here again."

The position was interesting, by foot you can easily go to the National Mall, the White House, the Convention Centre, but also to the Verizon Centre in few minutes more. Then in 7-8 minutes walk you have a metro stop with a direct connection to Arlington and the Reagan Airport. In the area there are a lot restaurants, Starbucks and a big Whole Food market where you can find everything you want to eat. The hotel itself has no frills, but it's surely comfortable. Although the room wasn't the biggest around, it was full equipped and the bed was really good, I slept wonderfully there. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The wifi connection was working fine and fast. Breakfast is served in a pleasant room downstairs, you have a good selection of different kind of food to chose from, there's something foe every taste. I loved the waffles I could make myself at the moment with a waffle-maker, soooo delicious. Another positive addiction is the free coffee in the lobby.

BTW - the closest Metro is .66 miles away, and it's uphill (not steep) coming back to the hotel. Dantise had great ideas, like a 4 hour night tour what was excellent. Dantise had the personality that all hotel clerks should have. She made our stay so nice. One elevator was broken so that made the stairs necessary to use."

When we arrived, there was only one staff member at the front desk, and the person ahead of us was checking in a group of teens. We waited patiently while the employee checked in this group, took payment for items some of the kids were buying in the shop, and dealt with a knocked-over glass jar of liquid that left a mess on the floor of the small lobby area. One of the two 5-person capacity elevators was out of order. Since our room was on the eighth floor, walking up with our luggage wasn't an option. We did use the stairs during most of our stay.The room itself was decent, if a big crowded. The windows had blackout shades, though a bit of light leaked through around the edges. We were at the rear of the hotel so didn't get any street noise; however, the AC could have been quieter. We did not hear much noise from other guests coming and going. The King room had a comfy bed, fridge, desk with chair, nice TV, full-length mirror, bedside tables, and good reading lights attached to the headboard. The bathroom was clean, but the only place to hang towels was on a rack in the tub; and there was no vent. The towels are minimalist, but clean.Breakfast was typical Comfort Inn fare. I would like to see some more healthful options, such as whole wheat bread and bagels. Orange and cranberry juices were depleted the first morning we were there.The location is good. If you enjoy walking and are not in a rush, you need not take a car or public transportation. We walked to all the major landmarks from the hotel. (My pedometer recorded 13 miles one day!) There are restaurants, take-out food establishments and services within walking distance. The area seemed safe.Now, the reason for my title: we left DC on Sunday morning and, when we arrived at our destination that evening, I discovered I had left my robe on the bed at the hotel. It is white and blended in with the sheets, so I didn't see it when I packed my luggage that morning. I called the hotel and spoke with a female. I told her when we had left and which room we had occupied. She took my contact information and said she would call me back. I never heard from her. When we returned home a few days later, I called again and spoke with Raj. He took my information and called back saying he had checked with housekeeping and laundry and no one had seen my robe. He left a message the following day, saying he had checked himself and did not find it. I do take responsibility for leaving the robe; however, I am confident it did not grow feet and walk away on its own. If the housekeeper did not notice it, and it got wrapped up in the sheets, the on-premises laundry worker should have come across it. I suspect that one of the employees is now the proud owner of my perfect travel robe.The photos were taken with my phone so the lighting isn't very good."

The hotel is located in a more residential neighborhood whereas over one street on 14th, it had a more commercial feel. Felt safe walking around. The hotel is small but kept up well. We had a decent corner room on the 5th floor and loved it, had a city scape view. Small rooms but after touring all day, it's not like we felt like leaping about the room. There is a firehouse down the street. You will hear them but it wasn't a deal-buster. Big TV, wireless worked great. Bathrooms were neat and tidy. Beds were comfortable. The elevators are small and a bit slow at breakfast time. Breakfast was fine. The typical food they always serve. Just don't go right at opening. The place was mobbed. Wait a half hour and you'll have a much better experience. More seating and fully stocked. All the employees I dealt with were polite and personable, efficient, like they wanted to be there. For the money, this is a good, little hotel. It's not a big, opulent place but I'd certainly go back. You can walk to tourist stuff easily if you're somewhat an active person. We walked to the tidal basin and back and it was a pretty good hoof but we're walkers. You'll be fine here. Utilize the Circulator for certain neighborhoods. From Union Station to 13th and K, it took us 25 minutes and cost $1.50. A taxi will run you $18.00. We walked easily (with small suitcases) from the bus stop a few blocks north to the hotel.

I have rarely stayed at a place where everyone was as keen as these people to make sure I was happy.It is also in a fantastic location: four blocks from the convention center. An easy walk to the National Mall or public transportation.But here's the let down: the rooms. OK, they're small. Not a deal breaker. But they're dismal. I couldn't tell if the carpet and bedding were old, or just not well kept. The wallpaper was scarred, peeling, and bubbling - not just in the bathroom, but the main room, too. The paint on the bathroom ceiling was bubbling: the sign of painted over mold. Then there's the smell. The first day it just seemed stale. But as the days progressed, my room had a growing sense of damp. A colleague had an even worse odor in his room. Another oddity was the placement of the hair dryer - right over the sink. One last oddity - a lamp on the desk wouldn't work and i assumed it was the bulb. Investigating a couple of days later, I discovered that it wasn't plugged in ... as there was no outlet anywhere near the lamp.The positives ... the bed was very comfortable. And the lounge/dining area in the basement was well decorated.The pictures on the hotel's website were obviously taken the day the renovations were completed - however many years ago that was. This could be an excellent place to stay. But it isn't."

The staff was exceptional too. Kyle met me at the front door with my key in hand, the GM (Mario) was always available and I saw him several times during my stay.

We were very impressed with the quality of customer service from the front of house staff - consistently happy, friendly, accommodating & helpful - with special thanks to Raj & Rachelle - you both do an excellent job!The hotel is located some distance from the main tourist areas but made for a peaceful stay in an otherwise busy city. Valet parking is available but quite expensive - we had little choice with a hire car as options are few - but were able to access this at any time of the day/night.Rooms are comfortable but very small & our king size bed (which was extremely comfortable) took up most of the space, making it a tight fit around existing furniture & our large suitcases & extra bags. Having said that ... who stays in a room longer than necessary when there's so much to see in DC?!The bathroom is also quite small but very clean & seviceable. It's located within an easy 20 minute walk of the White House....with many restaurants, museums, sights & monuments also within walking distance of the hotel...DC we found was an easy town to traverse by foot ...(see review on walking tours)Breakfast was a help yourself arrangement downstairs in a modern & recently re-furbished basement dining room with funky furniture & several tv's - cereals, yoghurt & fruit, hot scrambled eggs, bacon, toast & waffles...not gourmet but great when included in the price! We appreciated the provision of guest laundry facilities downstairs to wash & dry clothes during our stay too....not often an option in city hotels - coin operated & cheap. Overall we enjoyed our stay in this affordable hotel & loved our time in Washington DC - a fabulous city we hope to re-visit one day!"

If you don't mind walking you can also reach the White House on foot in about 25 minutes. Hotel is in an older building but rooms have been renovated and are comfortable. Breakfast Area is also renovated and nice. Breakfast itself is the typical Comfort Inn stuff, so ok. I don't like the styrofoam plates and think they should switch to something more environmentally friendly such as paper. Front Desk Manager was very friendly and even gave me an early check in. Have booked the same hotel again for a trip in October."

We were too early to check in. The only parking for this hotel is valet which is 5 blocks away @ $30 a day. We left to look for a store and found a deli a few blocks past the hotel. We returned to the hotel the rooms were still not ready. We asked if we could just unpack the car and park it. At this point they went out of there way to find us are rooms. We would have been happy to just get rid the car. The staff was very accommodating.The hotel is in the process of a face lift. It is a work in progress. Our rooms had new furniture and sm refrigerators were in the hallway just waiting to be put in. A nice young gentleman named Kyle helped us with our luggage and hook up the refrigerators. He was friendly and helpful as we later found out all the staff where. He filled us in on the up dates to the hotel & told us about the free breakfast on the lower floor. The breakfast/ lounge area could also be used to relax & enjoy a BYO cocktail. He also told us about the night guided tour of the monuments. We took his advice and went on the tour @ $37 each on an ac bus in 99 degree heat it sounded good to us. Kyle did not steer us wrong. The bus picked us up @ the hotel @ 7pm & returned us @ 10:30 we made several stop before the tour started the bus was full. Our room was smaller than our friend’s room maybe because it was a corner room. The good thing it was clean, the beds & pillows were comfortable & the ac worked great in both rooms. It had all the usual amenities & a clock radio with an Ipod dock all room had free wifi.Everyday after touring we would return to Noemil’s smiling faces the desk clerk asking about our day. Complimentary coffee, lemon aid & if you hit it right delicious cookies were in the lobby along with & computer & printer to use. We could not see how anyone could complain about the free breakfast buffet. They had it all coffee, tea, juice, fruit, scramble & hard boiled eggs, sausage, yogurt, pastries & breads, hot & cold cereal & milk. And of course make your own waffles. The room was full but there was plenty.It is about 5 blocks from the McPherson subway. We had a pleasant stay and if in the area we would stay again. It’s a smaller hotel with a lot of charm & warmth. We felt safe walking to the subway or area restaurants."

BIG mistake. The room was cramped and not very clean, the curtains were falling off the window on one side, and it was never fixed. Every time we called to ask for something, the front desk replied with, ""we don't have anyone to bring/do that."" Our refrigerator request was all but ignored, despite several groups checking out the first few days of our stay. The heating/cooling unit was under the window, and the bed was placed so that the person in that bed was freezing while the room remained warm. There was no fan in the bathroom, which made the Wash DC humidity even more unbearable. The bathroom window opened, but we had to use a phone book to keep it open for ventilation. The room was the smallest I've seen in a while. Two full beds with enough walkway between, and half that much on either side. The small armoire and desk and dresser took up the rest of the room almost completely. To make matters worse, the lobby consisted of a sofa in the small room where the computer was kept. So there was no where to escape for queit(er) time. The continental breakfast was ok. Lots of carbs. The make your own waffles were good, but more than one a week would have been too much. The hard boiled eggs got old fast. I would rather have had a better room and paid for breakfast. The breakfast room would have been a great place to escape the room during the day, except that it was locked, except for breakfast. We got stuck in the elevator twice, and the front desk didn't seem concerned at all. The location was okay, walking distance to bus stops and tour bus stops. The walls were thin, and facing the street, we heard every frequent siren, and boy are there a lot of them in DC! Overall, I cannot recommend this hotel at all. This hotel can charge what it does because all the hotels are overpriced, not because it is worth it. Spend a little more and pay for breakfast, you'll be glad you did."

And because of the way the room layed out I had windows on 3 walls, and even a window in the bathroom (rare), which makes the room feel less like a hotel and more open. The hotel was walking distance to all of the nations capital historic monuments, and next to great restaurants. The continental breakfast had a variety of everything, and very tasty. $120 well spent, this place is a perfect for those who don't want to spend a fortune on hotels only a few blocks away.

This hotel was chosen because we have a Choice Hotel Rewards card and this was the closest Choice Hotel. We flew into Reagan National and had Super Shuttle deliver us so we had no car to worry about. Like previous visitors, we also found hauling our one suitcase up the stairs to the check in desk a bit difficult. There is no ramp so I don’t know how a handicapped person would maneuver this hotel. During check in I jokingly asked the clerk, Fifi, if she was giving us a great room. She coldly asked me if I requested a quiet room ahead of time. So much for the joking around! We soon found that the room was neither quiet nor great. Comfort Inn Downtown sits on the corner of M and 13th Street NW. The closest metro station is on I and 14th which is four blocks south and one block west. Other than the occasional prostitute or crazy, there is no problem walking on the streets, which are clean and well maintained. The crossings at each corner are timed so you know exactly how much time you have to cross the street. There is never a long wait since the lights change frequently. True, there is a fire station down the street but none of the fire trucks we saw ever came from that station, which was a bit of a mystery to us. The Hard Rock café is on 10th street and F Street so it is a bit of a walk on a hot day. Likewise The Mall is on Independence and Constitution so from the hotel you have to walk south on 13th street past Massachusetts, L, K, I, H, New York, G, Pennsylvania, F, and EThere are 8 floors to this hotel and we had no problems with the elevators. Our room number was 700 and for some unknown reason was behind double doors with room 701. A check of the other floors confirmed this was the case on each floor. If you want quiet then ask for a different room. There was a group of kids staying in room 701 and instead of using their room key, they put the safety bar out. All we could hear all night long were the kids running up and down the hall, their door banging against that safety bar and the door from the hallway to our hallway banging shut. The layout is difficult to explain so you just have to take my word for it. We also had three windows; two with a view of the brick walls of room 701 and one with the side of a building under construction and the alley. Although they say you can see the White House from some of the rooms I find this very hard to believe based on the size of the buildings surrounding the hotel. Also note that although the sign near the elevator states ""vending machine"" with an arrow on each floor, there is actually only an ice machine and they are located only on floors 4 and 6. The room was comfortable and clean but there was no closet and only an armoire to hang clothes. Of course you had to move the chair out of the way to get to the armoire. Our king bed room only had three pillows so I left a note for the maid to please leave an extra pillow and she did. On one day we came back to the room at 5:30 to find the maid cleaning our room which we thought was a little late in the day but that was ok since our door keys no longer worked and she let us into our room.  The hotel does not have refrigerators in the rooms so they must have remodeled since the 2004 visit by one reviewer. There is no pool either and the fitness room contains a treadmill and stair climber. Although they offer the use of a PC in the lobby, it never worked and despite a daily request for it to be checked, the desk clerks just shrugged their shoulders and ignored us. The General Manager finally took me into his office on the last day so I could check in for my return flight but by then it was too late and we could not access the flight information.Breakfast was outstanding and located on the basement level in a huge room with a TV. Some of the offerings were coffee, tea, orange, apple and cranberry juice, granola bars, boiled eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, toast, bagels, pastries, cereal and waffles. We had no problem finding something to eat. Our only problem was the unfriendly and uncooperative worker in the breakfast room. If you run both waffle irons and the toaster at the same time the circuits will blow. The worker walks around like a zombie and does not respond to your questions or concerns. She completely ignores you. Usually we ate breakfast around 7 a.m. but on the last day did not eat breakfast until after 8. By that time several people had used the waffle iron so the waffles were sticking. There was no spray so the waffles had to be picked out with a plastic knife. One of the other guests did not believe me when I told him the worker would not help him and foolishly asked the worker for spray. The worker told the guest that the waffle irons are sprayed once each morning then didn’t say another word. If you plan to eat waffles make sure you are an early riser. There are a few fast food restaurants about 4 blocks south of the hotel such as Quiznos, Dominos and McDonalds. Café Mozart, an excellent German restaurant and deli is located on H Street where it crosses New York. CVS pharmacy / drug store is on 14th near F Street. Overall the hotel was neat and clean and not bad for the price, considering the breakfast bar and the fact that I am a Choice Rewards member. The hotel is a little far from the monuments and museums. Although I am used to walking, by the second day we were unable to walk for more than a short distance so used the Metro the rest of our stay. The staff did nothing to make me feel as if they were happy I chose their hotel and all were quite rude. I would certainly recommend to my friends that they find a hotel a little closer to The Mall."

My wife and I are a little older but we still walked to the White house and all the way to Lincoln Memorial. Yes it took all day, but we enjoyed the beauty of the city and all the monuments along the way. Lots to see if the weather cooperates. The food at the hotel is very good. They offer a breakfast buffet every morning that is really hard to beat. They have dinner buffet on Fri-Sat. It was also very good and both offer a very large selection. We had heard all the bad things and also read the reviews about the train noise. I asked when checking in if we could be placed on the opposite side from the train. They were more than happy to do so and put us in a corner suite with a great view. Very quite and never heard the train. If you ask and they have it, they are happy to do it. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows are amazing. My wife wanted to take one home! We had a refrigerator and large flat screen TV.. There was a desk area on one side of the room by one of the 3 windows and a seating area with a couch and small table to relax on and watch TV or play on your computer. We never do room service but it is available. We also declined maid service and I just got towels and wash cloths every morning and they were happy to give them to me. They also have a robe, slippers, hair dryer and all your toiletries. There is a awesome lounge downstairs that has live entertainment on Friday nights. They also have about 6 large TVs so you can watch your favorite sports events, which I did nightly. They also serve food until 11:30pm. They have a daily Happy Hour which was nice on the wallet but after that gets a bit pricey. However the weeknight bartender, Eric, was very good and very professional. Very knowledgeable and willing to talking about anything. Really great guy. If you do not like to walk, you can get anywhere from the hotel using Uber for about $5-$8. They are everywhere and best way to get around if you do not wanna walk. There is a CVS and McDonalds right next door. Drawbacks, there are no other places to eat in the area but you can find a place on Google and Uber will take you there. Same for sell of alcohol if you want some in your room. I found one little place with very limited on stuff down by the Wharf area. The Wharf area has a lot of places to eat. Also there are food trucks everywhere if that is your thing. Overall if you are going to DC to see the museums, monuments, White House, Capital, etc, this is a perfect location to do do. Friendly service and nice clean hotel."

The staff were pleasant, the room was very clean and spacious, sometimes the shower wasn't as hot as it could be. There are not many places to eat nearby but Starbuck's is connected to the lobby, the service is very slow in there. We ate at Capitol Bistro in the hotel and I highly recommend it. It's quiet and professional and the food was outstanding. The sumptuous breakfast with so much choice is served in here also. The hotel is located on the next block to both the National Air and Space Museum and the American Native Museum (highly recommended). There is a taxi rank out front and we found them to be both helpful and reasonably priced for a major city."

The bathroom shower had a constant drip, there were sugar ants near the coffee machine, the bathroom door was broken in multiple places (the door stop and the hooks were both broken off), and the lack of any sort of free breakfast was disappointing (but disclosed, so not necessarily surprising).The room had a generally slightly dirty feel, perhaps based on the aforementioned maintenance issues."

However, really pricey. I think the location aspect is overrated in a city like DC where you don't get much to do after evening (unlike NYC). My personal experience with this hotel wasn't good. 1. Booking - I made the mistake of calling the hotel for reservation. After reservation, they asked me if I want to know some promotions going on for the quick. I ended up being sold a Holiday Inn Timeshare promotion visit (199 USD) . When I realized the implications of the offer, they refused to refund2. Room Location - There is a railway track in the back of the hotel. After being tired all day,I wasn't able to get a good sleep with all the trains running around midnight3. Check In - When I checked in, the lady in the reception didn't even bother with the basic greetings. It felt like the hotel is doing me a favor for allowing me to stay for couple of days for 560 bucks(660 with taxes)"

It is also across the street from the entrance to the L’Enfant Plaza Metro Station. Of course being this close to the railway line results in some train noise, with odd numbered rooms on each floor between 53 and 81 being the most adversely affected. Unfortunately in our room 970 at the back of the hotel the loud noise from the air conditioner drowned out the trains and so we could not keep the AC on at night. The good side about the rooms at the rear of the hotel is that they had an elevator separate to the elevator bank at the front of the hotel, and this elevator provided easy access to the buffet and restaurant/bar as well as the guest laundry on level 2 ($2 wash, $2 dry). The evening buffet was $23.95 each and we ate there for 3 nights of our stay - it was always being refreshed (except for the desserts) and was good value. In the hotel is a Starbucks and a few doors down is s CVS Pharmacy and a McDonalds. The rooftop pool has a fine view of the Capitol dome, which is lit up at night. Except for the loud AC, our room (which looked over the quiet inside courtyard) was very comfortable with all the facilities you expect from a Holiday Inn. The front desk staff were friendly and very helpful. We recommend this hotel and would not hesitate at all to stay here again."

Needless to say we weren't disappointed. The hotel offers parking, but it's a bit pricey; fortunately we didn't need it this time. The service was great from check in until check out. Any problem is handled immediately and with a good attitude, such as faulty room keys or rowdy tour groups. The lobby is cavernous and has phone charging stations, comfortable seating, an adjacent courtyard outside, and a store that has a wide selection of food, drink and toiletries. The rooms are super-clean and have quality bedding, nice bathrooms, and plenty of towels. Our room also had a fridge, which comes in handy. The hotel has a pool on the roof, complete with lounge chairs, a lifeguard, and a bar. The workout room has a window overlooking the pool are as well. We also visited the ground floor bar, which was spacious and had good table service. We didn't visit the restaurant this time, but I wouldn't hesitate in the future.

This hotel is about a 20 min walk to the monument/cherry blossom area and maybe more like 35 min walk to Whitehouse. It’s a block area from the Smithsonian and air/space museum. Everything you need to see as a tourist is ‘in your backyard’ with this hotel so it’s a perfect location for sightseeing."

It was nice, clean, and modern. Very good location for seeing the sites and right next to one of the M train stations. The bad was the train that would come through in the night and wake me every time and other annoying outside noises. The shower head and water pressure are HORRIBLE - but the water does get nice and hot. Comfortable beds with choice of firm and soft pillows. Cooling/heating system worked well and fan can run continuously. The breakfast buffet was very good with a lot of options - not sure of the pricing - and the bar restaurant was tasty with burger and fries around $15. Many places to eat nearby and a CVS right next door. Plenty of cab service available at the door. Was not able to print out boarding pass in office - printer backed up and some of the computers were broken down, so don't count on that. Make sure to check bill at the end for incidentals - one of our travel companions had a movie added that they had not ordered. We are still waiting for two $50 incidental holds to be removed from our bank account - not sure yet why there are two because they said there would be one. Overall at this point, I would recommend this hotel."

The staff were great and so friendly and helpful in the hotel & restaurant. The restaurant (21st Amendment) had ""Happy Hours"" which was perfect after a day of touring. The food was great too. Starbucks is in the hotel and this was very handy to get breakfast and a hot chocolate. Location was great, close to the Smithsonian and other attractions. Would recommend this hotel, just try and get a room though which is not on the train tracks."

Perfect walking distance to many of the museums. Check in was easy and the king room I stayed in was clean and modern; however, the mattress was hard. Not a restful night if you have hip problems. Here's my beef and this pertains to any hotel...serve breakfast...even if it's just pastries and coffee and orange juice. I wanted to order room service for breakfast but I have an issue paying $14 for a breakfast sandwich comparable to an egg mcmuffin....when there's a McDonald's on the same block.

We were put directly on the tracks, but after the first night moved to another room overlooking the courtyard. The only downside to this place is the train whistles and train noise, even when not directly on the tracks. The hotel location was great and there is a capitol bikeshare about a block away as well as a CVS, and a few fast food places. During the week, one of the highlights for us were all the food trucks along 6th. The choices are endless and the food amazing! We did eat at one of the hotel restaurants one night and while not bad, nothing to write about.From my first night; I've been impressed with the customer services. They've given me nothing but stellar service. Over the years; several hotels have popped up and branded themselves on the wow!! Factor. However; the Holiday Inn-Capital lack lusters when its compared other contemporary or modernized hotel. Holiday still stands strong against other because of their strong & solid amenities: pool, business center, laundry areas, lobby and valet services. They're well known to give great service. I requested the rooms that were recently renovated. They didn't have any problems with accommodation. I was surprised to see the toliet seat wasn't replaced instead of poorly repaired. The seat was obnoxiously painted. The bathroom looks great , clean, sharp and sleek. However; the toilet seat was sore. I love the conveniences. The hotel is nearby/ walking distance to the Smithsonian museums. Circulator bus, metro station train ,bus , big bus. Captiolbistro, 21 amendment grill & bar , Starbucks; they're great!!! Instead of walking 2 or 3 mikes away ; we took advantage of the restaurant in the hotel. We ate here several times: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Compared to their menu the buffet have better options. I recommend that holiday inn should tweet their menu. Increase their options for gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, fruits. The choices are limited. The two restaurants have the same menu. The only difference is 21 Amendments has the bar and stays open until 1am. Again the customer services are stellar. This is a great hotel in the business district. Overall my stay have great. Recommendations: increase more options on the menu"

My check-in was a bit slow, and the guy at the front desk wasn't particularly friendly or informative, but no biggie.My room, a corner queen, was adequate in size, clean and comfortable. It featured a big wall-mounted HDTV, a larger-than-usual in-room fridge and an adequate work desk. The free WiFi was of a quite decent speed. The air conditioning unit kept the room cool, almost frigid at times, but in the sweltering early August D.C. heat, that was fine with me.The bathroom was small, but not claustrophobic, with the usual Holiday Inn coconut-overload bath products (they really need to consider a new brand). Also, the shower water was slow to heat up.Because of the location adjacent to the Smithsonian museums and the mall, there were lots of families with children in the hotel (and in the elevators!). It's also a block from the L'Enfant Plaza Metro station, a big bonus for getting around the D.C. area.There are very few restaurants in the immediate area, which is pretty dead after the museums close at 5:30 or so. A bar/grill and Starbucks are located in the hotel, and there's a McDonalds down the block, but that's pretty much it as far as nearby eats. But the lively Penn Quarter/Chinatown area, where there are plenty of restaurants and a busy night scene (atypical for downtown DC) is two metro stops north at Gallery Place/Chinatown."

Staff, rooms, location all excellent","Great location a block from the air and science museum, McDonalds, and the M Train station which had blue, silver, orange, yellow, and green trains to get everywhere. There was a capital bikeshare rack by the M station which we used to ride at dusk on evening to see the monuments lit up. Very relaxing and easy ride. We had a tour scheduled on the morning of our arrival. When the tour was over we got trapped in the rain and were soaking wet. Went back to hotel early to see if we could get into our room and we were able to check in at 12:30. They were so nice.We had King room and it had a big sofa in there which was comfy and relaxing after a full day of walking. The fridge was nice as well. Parking was very convenient, it was under the hotel, elevator in the lobby. We didn't have a lot of noise in our room. You could hear people in the hall sometimes when they are talking loud. Our room was very clean and the bed was very comfy.I have a gluten allergy and ate dinner at the restaurant. They could accommodate a few of their menu choices. I had a filet with no sauce and it was very good. It did not make me sick...So I am giving them a thumbs up on that as well. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in town!"

Our family of two children and two adults had been stuck in traffic for hours so it was nice to see how big and spacious the room was. My surprise came when I opened the curtains And saw the view of RR tracks around the entire room. I figured it couldn't be that bad, the children like trains so if one or two passed during our stay that would be fine. The first night we had one train at 11PM. But the second night, we had two to three trains hourly pass by those tracks from 11PM till we checked out the next morning!!! The room itself had an weird small right at the entrance but it faded away after we turned down the temp. The room was really hot and one of the air conditioners was not working, the remote control on TB in lounge area was broken and the safe had been looked in the open position. No biggie. We reported all of it to the front desk. When we returned from our outing, wire pieces were all over the floor, all AC were blowing air so loud we couldn't hear anything else in the room. The TV nor the safe were fixed. Neither of those were fixed during our stay. Because the room was very clean and We weren't watching much tv, we didn't bother to report it a third time. This hotel does make it easy to walk to the National Mall, it is clean and it has a restaurant on premise. However, we had a long 9 hour drive home and we really needed or sleep. I was very disappointed with this Holiday Inn and wish the staff would have given me the option to chose between my regular room in a quiet side or the suite with the train station."

I blatantly witness them going out of their way to greet and make their ""paying"" guests feel welcome. For example my family all paid for their rooms. I am a Spire Elite Member, I was rushed to check-in and was not acknowledged for my Spire Elite Status Amenity, I had to ask for it. I was at the hotel gift shop and happened to walk around the corner to pay, instead of letting me pay where I was, the FD Assoc said she would not complete my purchase until I walked around to the window. I am a low-key business traveler and hate it that I am treated differently when finally using my rewards nights.The first time I stayed here the trashed had not been emptied. The second visit there was clearly a crusted over fluid on the towel that housekeeping left on the Hand Towel Rack. I will not be staying at this hotel again. And seriously reconsidering holding business meeting is IHG Hotels in the future."

That doesn't seem fair at all.Excellent location for our short tour of the capitol. Check in & c/out was great staff friendly and no drama's. The rooms were excellent two Double beds per room which was clean & updated. Tea/coffee facilities, hotel bar & restaurant & on site parking is $40 a day in case you are driving.

We had dinner around town and came back to the room to wind down before bed time. My partner started itching on this leg and when I went to look at it, the area was very red. We thought it was a mosquito bite since we had gone out in the rain. Around 10pm he started scratching his arm and I asked him what was wrong and he showed me his arm….i saw 4 red welts on his arm and that’s when I freaked out. Something must be wrong. I immediately told him to call the front desk to alert them that there’s possible a bed bug infestation in our room (#708). They sent a supervisor and a guy from maintenance up to inspect the bed and even took off the sheet. We showed the supervisor the bites but she wouldn’t even look at it. She said if it’s bed bugs there should be signs. I told her the bugs could be inside the cracks of the headboard which is nailed to the wall so there’s no way to be 100% sure there are no bugs in the room. The carpeting is brownish, the side tables are brown. After much discussion, she just dismissed us. We said we wanted to change rooms. By this time it’s 10:30 and I am too scared to stay in the same room. We finally switched to a different side of the hotel on a higher floor (9th fl), I was told it’s the noisy side where the train rumbles through. We had no choice at this point. After the supervisor left we did find a dead bug underneath the sheet so I went downstairs to alert the front desk, I took a pic to show them and they just said they will send the supervisor upstairs again. I told them we are in a different room now and I am not stepping inside that room again. We barely managed to sleep since we’re totally freaked out at this point. The next day we NEVER heard from the supervisor or anyone at the front desk area even to ask if everything is working out for us or voiced their apologies. Our reservation was for 2 nights so we stayed the second night with no issues. I would advise anyone to stay away from the hotel and if you experience bites on your body to please bag up your clothing asap and wash everything (coats too) in hot water/dry for 45 mins when you get home. I currently have my luggage wrapped in 2 heavy duty garbage bags with pest control fumigator strips; plan to keep my bags quarantined for the next few months."

(Oops--I really thought I did it already). Well, I remember getting a good deal on the hotel room on Hotwire. The location itself was good. It wasn't far from all the sights. It happened to be an unusually hot weekend when we went (everyone kept saying how the temperature was much milder the weeks before). So, my plan of us walking everywhere was changed because we were sweating too much when we walked long distances. To save our energy we used uber and lyft a lot to get to our destinations. It was convenient because we never had to wait long at all for them to pick us up at the hotel. The room itself was very clean and the bed was comfy. The AC worked great which was a plus when we wanted to get away from that summer heat. I do remember arriving early to the hotel when we were checking in-- but they wouldn't let us check in yet. No biggie because we just stored our luggage with the bell hop and went exploring and came back at the check in time."

I've stayed here a few times now. The odd thing about this location is that even though I'm a long time Rewards Club member I'm never greeted as such or offered any perks when staying at this location. I always have to ask to make sure that I'm getting credit for my stay and even when I ask I'm never offered anything. Clearly that hasn't stopped me from staying here. It's just too convenient. The rooms are standard fare. I had reserved a King room, but when I checked in, the person admitting me seemed puzzled when he told me he had me in a double queen. When I told him my reservation was for a King he changed it, but there seemed to be more to it. I will say that the exercise room is better than other locations I've been to. Another plus was that the staff which takes care of the rooms hooked me up with extra creamers for the coffee station in the room. Thank you."

But the only close proximity issue I had was the proximity of the Virginia Railroad Express (VRE) track only because of the train horn. The front desk personnel was very nice and offered up great advice on local eateries. I ate at the 21st Amendment restaurant in the hotel and it was good. Service was good and food was good. Nothing special but I can't complain either. The room was fantastic and nicely appointed with plenty of room and workspace, if needed. The bed was comfortable and clean. So was the bathroom. I slept so well but the train horn woke me up way earlier than I wanted. If you are a Starbucks junkie like me, you are in luck because there is one near the hotel entry. It was a quick trip to the hotel on the metro from Reagan National. Seriously, about a 10 min commute on the subway and 3 minute walk from the station to the hotel. If you are commuting via the VRE, this would be an ideal location too due to the proximity to L'Enfant station (this is an assumption because I used the metro but I know that L'Enfant services both the metro and VRE). Even though the train woke me up during my stay each morning, I would recommend this hotel to a friend."

The steak tacos in the grill were uninspired and the sauce on top looked questionable, even though the taste was okay. I suggest the kitchen leave sauces on the side. The buffet breakfast in the restaurant is a little pricey, but does include a made to order omelet. The scrambled eggs on the buffet always looked overly wet and unappealing.At check in the lady that checked me in held up my key jacket with room number publicly visible. She loudly said the room and held it up the ENTIRE time she talked to me. As a female business traveler, I was highly uncomfortable. There were several male staff at bell desk (standing around) and I felt like she was announcing my information to victimize me. I don't consider myself dramatic and I really didn't understand her behavior. The location is convenient. There were lots of families and business travelers staying at the hotel. Take care to ask if your room will be located near the train tracks because my stay was noisy."

First off, that train tracks run right behind this building. Be aware, there is a crossing nearby making it hard to get a good night sleep with the train blowing it's whistle at all hours! When we confronted the front desk about the extremely loud train noise we were asked why we hadn't called in advance to ask about this hotel possibly having a train nearby. Really?!?! This room is over priced because of this and be aware there is a hefty daily charge for parking on top of the already high price for this room. A couple of other things, the insulated wrap used to wrap the pipes under the sink to keep the legs of those who are paralyzed from getting burned was not wrapped around the pipe. Instead, it was shoved up under the sink. It was apparent that it had come off and they didn't want to be bothered putting it back on correctly. Plus, the padded seat in the shower was missing one of the 3 screws and one of the other ones was coming out of the wall. They did offer to put us in a different room, however, we had already unpacked all of our suitcases and moving rooms would not take care of the train racket. Keep in mind, it would have been worth it if it hadn't been for the train noise. After complaining, Sam, the manager did say he would knock some money off, but when we checked out this hadn't happened. He was off that day, so the manager on duty had to call him at home to verify what had transpired. There are 2 restaurants and a Starbucks located on site. Plus, they do a laundry room."

I was attending a conference in the area and the location was fabulous, both for sightseeing and for my conference. It is an easy walk to the L'Enfant metro stop. The Smithsonians and the mall are also an easy walk. Check-in was a bit busy and slow but went smoothly. When I entered the room, it was spacious, pleasant and clean. They left a mask and earplugs out on the bed, which was my first clue that there would be a noise problem. There was no microwave but there was a small refrigerator, which given the heat and humidity was great for water and Gatorade, as well as skim milk for cereal in the mornings (there is no breakfast included). The water pressure was sporadically good and weak, all in the same shower, but overall, good enough to have a nice shower in the morning. I used the ear plugs, but even with them in, the trains went by during the early morning hours and woke me up. Because everything else was satisfactory, I tried to acclimate to it, but I did go to the front desk on Wednesday and ask to be moved. She said they were very full. I would probably need to stay where I was. I asked if there really wasn't anything on the quieter side and she said I could try back in person only around 11:00 a.m.. I said I was at a conference all day and she just said, well, the train really didn't bother very many people. At check-out I did share with a different desk clerk when she asked about the stay, that I was satisfied except for the trains and that I was absolutely exhausted. She said that they could have moved me, and was a bit surprised that I had not been accommodated. I do want to say that the bed and the pillows were quite comfortable. In sum, would I stay there again? Because of the location and quality of the overall experience, yes, but ONLY away from the train side of the hotel."

This last trip was for the week of 4th of July so we thought we would try to stay a little closer to the Mall for ease of travel on the day of celebration. We didn't know much of the hotel other than walking past several times on the way to and from the Metro station. We didn't have very high expectations, again this stay was for the location only. Our room was not ready for check-in until after 5 pm, but the front desk staff was quite apologetic and nice. Once we arrived in our room, we were please with it. Our room was spotless and roomy enough for me and our two children. The beds were comfortable and the room was very quiet even though it was a full house. The kids LOVED the rooftop pool and even though it was quite crowded with kids, especially at night, there was a lifeguard at all times to keep order. There is a nice view of the Capitol building, but not much else. There is a full stock of clean towels and a bar open a few hours each afternoon and evening. There are two restaurants, but we only tried one of them, the Capitol Bistro. The other restaurant seemed more of a bar, quite loud. The food was decent enough, but the staff was outstanding, especially a young woman named Migali who went way above and beyond to accommodate my picky children's eating preferences. There is a small area with printers to print out boarding passes which I genuinely appreciated. The location cannot be beat, literally steps behind the Air & Space Museum, very close to the Metro station and food court at L'Enfant Plaza. We felt safe walking the neighborhood both in the daytime as well as late night. Overall, our 6 nights were outstanding and without a doubt would highly recommend this hotel! We have definitely switched our ""go to"" hotel in DC to this Holiday Inn!!"

I didn't have a car and the hotel was perfect for me. It's a huge hotel with lots of rooms. My room was big, well decorated, pretty new with a little fridge, flat tv and the basic amenities. The bathroom was beautiful and modern. The staff was OK. I never visited the pool area because all day I was busy visiting the museums, but looks that many people with kids enjoyed the pool.

Amazing!!!Breakfast is really expensive, but there is a Starbucks nearby where you can get a coffee and a pastry for a good price before heading off to the city.The quality of tea bags is not good, being English I can really feel it.In the room only coffee machine does not help to have a cup of tea, as you need to brew hot water through the coffee empty filter and it will automatically taste of coffee. I think a kettle in the room in addition would have been really helpful in the offer."

Both restaurants had great food and in the 21st amendment bar they had a great Jazz band several nights a week. We were able to walk the National mall and Union station which is the hub to go everywhere. It was close to everything. We also used the Circulator the travel around to see all the monuments on the mall and it passes about every 10 minutes at specific stops all around the National mall.

The in room coffee machine didn’t work at all but it was a minor inconvenience and the reception staff was most apoplectic when I informed them. The onsite dining at the 21st Amendment Bar and Grill was not bad and reasonably priced, there were not a lot of other options I could see locally apart from a close by McDonalds! The pubic areas are clean and spacious and there is a small self-service shop with convenience foods and microwavable meals (and a microwave) next to reception. There is also a smaller independent shop by the side entrance mainly selling souvenirs and soft drinks. The hotel very close to the National Mall museums and to L’Enfant Metro Station. The price we paid for the room was reasonable and the staff professional and pleasant as always with Holiday Inn hotels. The WiFi signal in the room was strong, free and reliable."

The location of the hotel is awesome for exploring but not so awesome for food. If you plan to walk or ride the metro everywhere like we did, plan on going a way out to find food. There are restaurants in the hotel including a buffet but it is very expensive. The breakfast buffet is around $17 a person. Beware, parking is $37 a day. This cost adds up quickly. Also, there was a fenced off area in the parking deck that had piles and boxes of stuff. Kinda just an eyesore. I guess it was the hotel's storage. I'm not really sure. The room we stayed in was very nice. There are a few things that bothered me about the room though. Our room was right beside the train so we were awoken many times by the horn. The water pressure in the shower was really weird. The pressure started out strong and then weak, almost to nothing, off and on throughout every shower. I realize this may not bother everyone, but it bothered me. Also, the air conditioning (yes we had to use the air) made a screeching sound everytime it was on. This was highly annoying.There was also a roach in our bed the last night we were there. This was not the first time I saw the roach either. Overall, this hotel was nice and only has minor things that could be fixed. We would stay here again."

It certainly is the most expensive by long short. I booked it because it was very close (about 100 metres) from the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum which was the primarily goal of my visit to Washington DC. I thought the service was okay, breakfast was good - very good spread for an American hotel. The rooms were newly renovated but they left the guts (e.g. the aircon system) unchanged. Rooms were comfortably big. Yes, there are street noises and noises from the railway nearby but that didn't bother us. My better half is a light sleeper. We were staying on the 4th floor so it's not that we were on a very high floor. The hotel has a indoor swimming pool and gym - both of which we didn't use. 24 hour carpark costs US$37. The best part of the hotel I guess is the location to various attractions - the monuments, the White House and Capitol Hill which are all walking distance. The one furthest away is the Abraham Lincoln memorial which is a good 2km away but still walkable for most."

For that alone it earns a four-star rating. The Smithsonian museums, the Washington Monument, the National Botanical Gardens, the Metro, are all within about a 20-minute walk from the Holiday Inn. The Old Town Trolley will pick you up at their door in the morning, and you can even buy tickets for it right in the hotel's gift shop, although it's only a short walk to the Air & Space Museum, which is one of their stops. You can get on and off there, which is what we did most times. I could go on praising the location of the hotel, but many other reviewers have done so already, justifiably so.Otherwise, it's a pretty ordinary hotel. I felt that it was lacking in some of the amenities one would usually find in a big-city hotel. It's pricey of course, but not as expensive as some of the nearby boutique hotels. We chose an ""executive"" room instead of just a standard one. It was large enough (although there wasn't much room between the foot of the bed and the dresser) comfortable and clean. The climate control system worked perfectly. For the price, we would have liked to have had a tub option in the bathroom instead of just a shower, but that's not a big deal. Our room faced the courtyard, and we could hear the train whistle that many reviewers have mentioned in the distance but we didn't find it bothersome; certainly not enough to wake us up through the night. The bed was comfortable and the mattress didn't have that hollowed-out spot in it that you sometimes find, indicating that it should be replaced.The biggest disappointment in our room was the coffee maker. I don't drink coffee, only tea. There were some teabags there, but only the decaffeinated version, which I don't usually drink. The first night I left a note for the housekeeper to please include some regular teabags and she did leave a couple the next day, but after that it was back to only the decaffeinated ones for the rest of our stay. And this is the only hotel I've stayed at for as long as I can remember where a guest couldn't get a free cup of coffee or tea in the lobby at any time of day or night.They do offer a breakfast buffet, but it is not included in the price of the room. We didn't try it, but previous reviewers have not treated it kindly. I think you would be better off getting your breakfast at the Wall Street Deli, a few doors down between the CVS and the McDonald's. If a muffin, donut, or egg sandwich will satisfy you, there is a cart set up in the lobby with a good selection and a pleasant cashier.I recommend that you choose the parking package for your stay (if you come by car). That adds $30 a night to your bill, but is cheaper than the garage's usual daily rate and allows in-and-out access throughout the day.All in all, although I would like to see some improvements made, this is a hotel I would choose again for another stay in Washington."

They aren't just noisy, they shake the room. We were only here for the night, so we put up with it. I would never stay again in this room. We stayed at this hotel because my wife had a committee meeting literally across the street, so it was convenient. It's also very close to the mall grounds and Smithsonian museums.

The commuter rail was RIGHT outside our window (4th floor) and loud. Not so bad on weekends, but weekday trains start running by 6am. I could hear them even with earplugs in. My son, however, was thrilled and ate breakfast each morning facing the 'view' out the window. Overall, we were ok but this could be a deal breaker for others.2) Air conditioning: was set to a motion sensor! We didn't figure this out until the last night of our stay, and had been wondering why the unit wasn't working well at night- I woke up several times each night sweating (and I run cool). While sleeping, sensor doesn't trip! Husband looked on YouTube and found a way to bypass the sensor, which solved the problem- but I think this is a lousy trick to play on patrons who pay a good deal of $ to stay there and should have a/c running at night if they wish.3) You need to venture away from hotel to find restaurants. Hotel restaurants are ok but overpriced for what you get. Service at Starbucks is pathetic- took me over 20 min to get an iced coffee with relatively few people in line, and it was boiling hot waiting in the place. No self-respecting Dunks customer would tolerate that on a regular basis."

Clean, comfortable well staffed. Large room with free wifi and Kuriug coffee machine. Best of all you are walking distance from everything on the National Mall.

The rooftop pool was great. Had been under construction but it was still open and looked amazing. Small but couldn't complain because it was nice to have somewhere to relax and cool off. There are a couple of restaurants in the hotel but only tried the buffet, which was a little on the high dollar end. Wonderful food. Starbucks was on the corner! And a few other fast food restaurants on the same block, McDonald's was our main pick at times. The metro was a block away, which is a major plus. Hotel was very clean and staff was nice and friendly. Will stay again."

We walked to all the museums and even up to The International Spy Museum, which I will admit is a bit of a hike in 95+ weather. We also walked to the Vietnam war memorial and the White House. I have already recommended this hotel to my friends. The only issue we had was parking. It is true, if you have a small car bring that one. We don't and it was extremely tight parking. We had to pull both mirrors in to fit into the parking space. We parked on the first level so I don't know if it is any better on a higher floor. We worried that we would get dinged but we didn't. There is a parking fee that we managed to get for $10.00 a day with a package the hotel offered. Take your parking ticket to the check in and they will take care of it. Check in was smooth and they gave us a couple of drink coupons and a couple of bottles of water because we are Priority Club members. When we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised. It was very modern with a view of the courtyard. Everything was spotless. The room also had a flat screen tv, Keurig coffeemaker and a small fridge. Perfect for a weekend trip. As far as the restaurants not being plentiful around the hotel, it is very easy while sightseeing to stop at restaurants before returning to the hotel. If you don't, yes there is McDonald's, Subway and Quizno's right there at street level. It is not a problem. I should mention when driving to this hotel it can't be any easier to find, right off the highway, just a couple of blocks up. I always wanted to spend a couple of nights in Washington and now we have found the perfect way to enjoy the town in this centrally located hotel. We will be back."

We had two queen beds in the room and had plenty of space to spread out. This was perfect for the adults and two grandkids.The L'Enfante metro station is just a block or two away, and the Air & Space museum is only 2 blocks away. We ended up walking everywhere after our first day. If you're a walker than most of the historical sights are fairly well accessible and within a mile or mile and a half.There is a Starbucks connected to the hotel on the first floor, a McDonald's and Quiznos half a block away, and a restaurant on the premises. I would not recommend the on site restaurant - prices are high, food is average (the buffet was almost inedible), and service is not very good, and worse when it is crowded. The only other issues we had were the internet and the elevators - both were pretty slow.However, after staying in NYC in a higher priced but smaller hotel we were happy with our choice in DC. It is a great place if you have kids - the pool was great and is on the top floor outside, so it's a good place to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing. Front desk service was very friendly. Parking is in the underground parking lot, and although expensive, comes with unlimited in-and-out privileges.The room comes with a coffeemaker and a fridge, but no microwave. There are free microwaves on the first floor in the room that sells incidentals and food items.I would definitely stay here again especially if you have a family."

The L'Enfant Metro Station is within a few minutes walking distance which services orange, blue, silver, yellow, and green lines. If you fly into Washington Reagan Airport you can take the Yellow line towards Fort Trotten/Green Belt, get off at L'Enfant Plaza and walk to the hotel. The hotel is really clean and comfortable and if it wasn't for all of the awesome sites calling my name I would have stayed in the room all day :) The only downsides are the train tracks right next to the hotel (so get an interior room because it can get loud), it is located downtown so a lot of food places and entrances to the metro are closed on weekends, and there aren't too many places to eat but I guess that's ok because the Capitol and a ton of places are within walking distance!"

The location was very convenient for my particular business plans. The locations is about a block away from the L'Enfant Subway entrance, about two blocks south of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, a couple of blocks from the Capital building, and close proximity to all of the Federal Government offices.The Hotel is a typical business traveler hotel. The amenities were standard. The room seemed clean, though had minor signs of disrepair. It included a Keurig coffee machine, Iron, TV, iPod (legacy) enabled alarm clock and a few other standard sorts.I did not have trouble with noisy neighbors, but could here people in their rooms when I walked down the hall. I was on the north side of the hotel, but could still hear the trains that are on the south side of the hotel (Amtrack and a freight line I believe). On the fifth floor I could also hear some road noise early in the morning. Check in, and check out were non-eventful, pretty standard process and fast. The biggest draw back of the hotel is lack of locations within walking distances for restaurants. The hotel does have two hotel restaurants, but aside from this there are only a handful of fast food joints within a walking radius. This is not a big deal as the subway is only a block away and two stops north has a plethora of restaurants (this is still only about 10-11 blocks walking).Overall the location could not be much better for my business needs and the staff was friendly."

My room pictures are an exact match to those posted for a king size room. We did find the mattress uncomfortable for sleeping, too firm for our liking, but liked having both soft and firm pillows on bed to choose from. House keeping was excellent and returned our room to check -in order each day which made it a very welcoming space. I would stay here again. Especially if my time spent in DC is focused around visiting the museums."

Also very convenient for government offices if you're on a business trip. The staff at the front desk were exceptionally friendly and helpful.The fitness centre is well-equipped for a hotel.Breakfast was mainly hot ""american style"" - sausage, various types of egg, pancakes, biscuits etc. Some fruit, yoghurt and cereal available. Service was a bit erratic! Good black-out curtains in room but be warned there are noise issues as the hotel is right next to the train track. Also, the fridge in the room is very noisy and there is no way to switch it off. The 21st Amendment bar is good for a drink and food - although service was variable. However, I have the same gripe as last year. I ordered a bottle of wine and, as I had been unhappy last year ordered one that was specifically recommended by the manager. It cost 36 USD before tip and it was appalling quality. Unfortunately I didn't taste it until I was in my room and I was too tired and jet-lagged to take it back but it really was shockingly bad - especially considering the price.Btw, there is a small mini-mart in the hotel. It is a bit expensive but there is nothing else in the vicinity so it's useful to have."

What a surprise! I have a King Leisure Room and it is HUGE and modern. Love the spacious bathroom with walk-in shower, and the very comfortable bed. Although there are not many places for dinner in the immediate area, it is convenient to L'Enfant Metro. Free wifi, Keurig (with TEA provided as well as coffee), small fridge. The only downside is the location near the train tracks - jolted me awake about 1am when it sounded like a train was flying by just outside my room (it was!). But I will definitely try to book here again when I am back in Washington DC!Popped in for a quick overnight stay on the way home from NYC. Staff was friendly both on the phone and in person. Good parking available and location is excellent. We decided to stop in DC to let the kids get a taste of a future vacation...arrived after dark and once we checked in we were able to walk the very short distance over to the National Mall for a few night time picts and let the kids ogle in the windows of the Air and Space Museum as well. Got back to the hotel and the restaurant is open fairly late and serves some excellent fair."

We stayed at the Holiday Inn-Capital. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff. We had booked 2 rooms, but neither were ready yet, which was fine with us. We figure we would do a little sightseeing, and than come back in and check in later in the day. We were really impressed with the rooms. We were on the 7th floor, and on the opposite side of where the train. We were very impressed with the rooms. One room, had a King size bed, and the other had 2 queens (which we requested) Flat screen tv, coffee maker, nice size bathroom (with hair dyer, and even cute travel lotions from bath & body works), nice view over looking the street of Washington. It is also convenient location, as the Air & Space Musuem is within walking distance from hotel. Food at the hotel was good! Had breakfast at the Capital Bistro one morning, buffet was average price $15.95, which is pretty average, nice selection of food. Had sandwiches at the Express Deli, prices were resonable, not to mention the sandwiches were huge! Also, dined at the Capital Bistro for dinner one night, food was delish! We had also purchased the Big Bus 2 day pass, which was well worth it for sightseeing around Washington. It was so nice to be able to hop on, hop off as many times as we wanted, which was great! I also would recommend dining at Carmine's Restuarant (7th St NW). It is family style. The prices weren't too bad, considering the portions are huge! Great service & food!! Yum!! Looking forward to visiting Washington, Dc again in a few years, and def staying at the Holiday Inn again!! Thanks for a great time!! :)"

It averaged about $200/night including the cost of parking. We originally picked it as it was about 400 yards from the Air and Space museum, and the mall. We did not want to have to drive anywhere if possible. Rooms: honestly for the price in a major city, I was very impressed. Nice beds, queens, not full, and great pillows. The hotel was completely remodeled, and it shows. Tons of space for clothes, and counter space for all your stuff that accumulates on family trips. Fridge in room, as well as Keurig coffee maker. We did not have a great view as we were on the third floor (overlooked the DOE building) but honestly that was the only downfall and I think they would have changed us if I had asked.Staff: very helpful, attentive, great job overall.Pool: rooftop pool with amazing view of the capital. Great for the kids and parents after a long day walking. It was not heated, that I could tell, as it was a bit chilly on an 80 degree day, but still, great for a refreshing dip in the afternoon.Room Servicet: We did room service one night as we got in late. 4 club sandwiches was about $56 with tip. A little crazy but it is room service. They also come pick up the tray if you call and it was gone within 15 minutes. I have to say that is one thing that always is a downfall of hotels: room service trays in the hallways all night, and into the next day. gross. So, their quick retrieval was an A+ in my book.Restaurant: We went to the 21st amendment bar and grill on our first night. The service was very slow: from the time we sat until we left was over 2 hours. With a 10 and 12 year old, this could have been a nightmare, but they were tires and had their electronics. Not a ton to choose from on the menu. I got the bison burger. a BLT, a sirloin salad and grilled cheese rounded out the meals. With two drinks our bill was over $100 which, for the quality was not what we expected. I live in a city in the Boston area and $100 gets you a hell of a lot more good quality good. I would not go here again.Parking: below building, easy access, you can come and go as many times as you wish for no extra charge. Starbucks in the lobby = great!Overall, the price is what pulled us in. I would not recommend the food unless you are exhausted and can't walk to another establishment. Location is perfect for the Mall, and Capital area. Friendly staff. great pool. Beautiful upgrades to the rooms. Quiet, quiet, quiet hallways and rooms, never heard a peep from any neighbors."

I sent a email to the hotel 3 weeks prior to arrival requesting a room facing the courtyard and a 1.00 early Check in I received a email back from the hotel stated that this cannot be guaranteed but they will try if available. I requested the courtyard view because all trip advisor reviews recommend that part of the hotel because of the noise from the train. We did arrive at the hotel at 1.30 from Regan National and was told the hotel is sold out and the room will not be ready until 3.00 pm. That was fine because we have been travelling for 12 hours and have not had lunch, so we went for lunch and returned at 3.00. The check in staff told us the room is still not ready and was not sure when it would be available, so I waited till 3.30 to check again. I was getting annoyed and the staff said, check in STARTS at 3.00 and I said the holiday inn web site specifically states, check in is AT 3.00. So she started arguing with me about how check in starts at 3.00 and we just have to wait. I said my time us valuable and said I should be compensated for the wait and she said no, I was not entitled to anything, and again she stated check in starts at 3.00. I was getting mad because she was so non accommodating and arguing. She said do you want to see the manager and I said yes, so she came out and I asked her when the room will be ready and she said, it is not ready. I knew she was not going to help so I gave up and just waited.As you can tell by my profile I travel the world, most hotels would say, here is a wine coupon and please wait in the lounge and have complimentary wine or coffee and not argue. It is obvious the staff are not trained on problem resolution and the hotel management lack the skills to facilitate the communication leader ship needed to run a major hotel. We finally got into our room at 4.30. Once we got into our room there was a service guarantee sign in the bathroom, I think the sign is for show because the attitude of the hotel does not guarantee anything. During our 3 day stay, we were never spoken to, said hello to, or asked how we were enjoying our stay. I was in Seattle a few months again at the Sheraton and every time I came down the elevator I was greeting and called by my last name. The best hotel service was the Westin at Union Square, San Francisco. The concierge and staff are trained to greet all guest with courtesy and respect not like the holiday inn Capital. We requested a late check out on our last day but denied, which I expected ending a bad hotel experience. The hotel stay started on a bad experience and ended on a disappointing note.Reading other negative trip advisor reviews, the issues are about staff communication issues and bad customer relations. If I was corporate hotel management I would certainly investigate that issue. If poor customer service affects 10% of customers not returning or affecting 10% of possible customers not staying here because they are reading poor service, I would be concern from a corporate level.Regardless if the hotel is in a good location people skills trump the physical building location"

We found this hotel to be ideal as it put us in walking distance of just about everything including the White House.The rooms were well maintained and cleaned. The beds were comfy and the rooms had all the normal facilities.The Panda Package had a very cute plush but the other contents were pretty naff so just be aware of what you're buying!

Weekend,"Expected an average, old, but clean hotel. Half the price of the others in the area. Had poor reviews relating to the noisy train, dated decor, etc. Walked in to a newly renovated lobby, with staff happy to see us and efficiently handled our check in. Even more surprised to walk through what looked like a newly renovated corridor to our room to find our room had also been completely renovated! Brand new everything! Exceptionally comfortable beds with a good choice of pillows. Lights everywhere! Brand new bathroom. The train is an issue if you are a light sleeper, even if you are in a room over looking the courtyard. Ear plugs fix that. Efficient and reasonable room service. Two restaurants (one with al la carte and buffet dining, one with a bar). A Starbucks and a small gift shop. Two minute walk to the Aeronautic museum. Five minute to the mall. Double decker hop on/off bus leaves from outside the museum every 20 minutes and goes to all major attractions. Absolutely brilliant value and perfectly located. Would stay again.Selected this hotel for a long weekend to see the sites. Parked in the garage below hotel, yes there is a fee but took advantage of a parking/room package offered which saved some money. The rooms are newly renovated top to bottom with a nice design. Offers soft & firm pillows on beds, nice to have a choice. I did read other reviews and asked for a room on the street side as I had children and didn't want to be near the train side. I couldn't check in until late afternoon due to my request but that was fine with me. We checked our bags with the bellman and off we went for a bit. Had breakfast one morning in the restaurant, busy but not a problem...kids eat free...yeah! Yes they charge $50 incidental if check in with a debit card, again no problem here that is very common in the industry and it bothers me when people complain about it in reviews so I'm giving a heads up :) Will return again."

Friendly helpful staff. Good location in Capitol Hill area close to metro and attractions. The hotel is a bit expensive but not disproportionate for this area of Washington. The breakfast is a hot American-stylebuffet including biscuits with gravy and pancakes, if you like that sort if thing. I enjoyed the scrambled egg with spinach and mushroom. There is fruit, cereal and oatmeal. When you sit down you are quickly brought a large glass of freshly squeezed juice, iced water and your choice of tea or coffee. For me, personally, it was missing a selection of breads (only toast bread) and cold options such as cheeses etc. But that is personal taste of course. It seemed like you could also order à la carte if you wanted.Very good fitness centre for a hotel - including 4 treadmills and a bigger selection of free weights than you normally get in Europe. Only two gripes - the wine from the bar was very poor quality for the price and there is no kettle, just a tea/coffee machine in the room which only works with the capsules provided (choice of either de-caf coffee or a rather sour breakfast tea)."

The room was spacious and the biggest on our trip, the bathroom was nice and the bed was comfortable. The only issue we had was there was no bath plug and it took 40 minutes for the staff to find one which was odd.Again the closeness of this place to the museums and sites is it's selling point, one drawbacks is the lack of restaurants in the area it's pretty much barren and the food in the lobby isn't the greatest, forking out for a cab or the subway is the way to go to get a decent meal."

Checkin was slow but there were a lot of people arriving the same time we did. Room was average and the bed was comfortable. Our room overlooked the street and train station. We did hear the train whistle / horn in the morning from a commuter train ... but I like trains so this didn't bother me. There is a Starbucks, McDonalds and CVS nearby and the hotel has a restaurant and quick counter deli/ shop. The hotel has underground parking. We brought our bicycles and we rode them out of the underground garage, it was a very short ride to the national mall. The hotel has a pool on the roof. We didn't use it but take time to go up, at least for the view."

Both times I stayed there as a chaperone for a school trip. The first night I had hot water in my room. Day 2-4 there was NO hot water. If I was lucky I had ""luke warm"" water. I would not suggest a room facing the train OR the elevator as it was very noisy. The hotel has a CVS located right next door (only open 7-7 without a pharmacy). There is also a Starbucks located in this hotel.Definitely recommend. Three of us spent 6 nights at this hotel - check-in was great and we were upgraded to a suite. This happened to be at the back of the hotel next to the railway tracks but being high up the noise didn't disturb me - an occasional train whistle but that was all. Asked for some extra pillows and they took two phone calls and over half an hour to arrive so maybe they can improve that service. I had the sofa bed which was comfortable. Centrally located within walking distance to the Smithsonian's is a plus but it is a fair hike to the main restaurant area. The hotel restaurant/cafe was expensive - McDonalds is about a 5 minute walk so that was good for breakfast. Room was clean, although the air conditioner unit in the hallway was noisy, we did not hear it in the room."

Its rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the food served in its Bar and Grill (delightfully named ""The 21st Amendment"") is what one would expect - not exactly gourmet, but perfectly adequate, to keep body and soul together while tramping the Mall.The location, however, is nothing short of amazing. The hotel is about a block from the National Air and Space Museum, and there's a Metro stop (L'Enfant Plaza) right across the road. Better still, the Mall is only a short walk. This hotel is a perfect place to use as a base, if you want to see the DC Museums and Monuments.There are some downsides to this location, though. The hotel is surrounded by government offices, there seems to be a lack of restaurants in the vicinity, and the whole area goes to sleep after five pm. There is an underground car park beneath the hotel, but overnight parking is relatively expensive ($35). Sounds astronomical, but compares reasonably with the cost of parking for 24 hours in the middle of any major city. If you leave your car at home, and visit Washington DC by train, this problem shouldn't arise.We were just passing through on the way to somewhere else, and stayed only one night. However, the convenient location meant that we had enough time to walk the Mall, see the Christmas lights, and spend some of the following day in the National Air and Space Museum. Not nearly enough time to see everything, but enough to whet our appetite. We'll be back, and there's a good chance that we'll stay in the Holiday Inn."

I called before i checked in to make sure my accompany would be able to check in with out me and they said ""yes no problem as long as they have the white card at check in"". My accompany Janet Romero arrived with the employee card late around 11 pm tired and ready to get some rest but they would not check her in because I wasn't present. I called and spoke to the guest service representative as Janet was checking in and was denied the employee rate with out my presets he told me he would have to change the rate to the $89 rate. I then asked to speak to a Manager and was able to speak to a Stephanie Hunter,she informed me that they would not be able to check in my accompany with out my presets I explained to her that i was in NY and wasn't coming back until next week. Stephanie didn't seem to care at all she told me they would have to pay full amount which was $102 a night after the other employee told me it would be $89 a night. That is so unprofessional and very upsetting! after speaking to the manger for 20 min she started questioning me if i was even an employee at a Holiday Inn which was really stupid and unprofessional of her! At that point I had enough with her! I spoke again GSR and he told me he would give me the $89 rate until i showed up. I had to drive back the next morning all the from NY just to be present and get the employee rate. That next morning there wasn't any water and were given water bottles to shower with how disturbing that was for my guest! When i got there to show my presents i noticed our heat wasn't working. The engineering guys was so friendly and awesome, he fixed our heat but after 5 min it didn't work again. I called the front desk and the GSR on duty was very rude! I explained to her that i was trying to get in shower and needed to know if we had to move rooms or not she told me ' I don't know I will have to call you back"". That for me isn't good costumer service! we finally moved rooms and they did not seem to car nor did they apologize for the disturbance. When we got into the elevator it looked liked housekeeping storage room i took pictures and will be sending them in as well. I've stayed at many IHG hotel properties and this has been the worst service! Coming from someone who works at a hotel dealing with costumer services on daily bases I was really upset on how this staff delivers costumer service and i check out i wasn't asked how my stay was and I must say Stephanie Hunter doesn't deserve the manager position she really needs to take costumer service classes."

Bed was comfortable, shower was hot with good water pressure and the room was laid out well. Did room service for breakfast and that was fast and good. Hung out at the bar late one night and they had music and dancing. Only negative was that the woman who checked me in wasn't friendly, at all.

First time in the US so it was a bit of a daunting trip. But we booked the Holiday Inn Capitol soley for its locality and we weren't disappointed. Everything is literally around the corner. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the whole hotel was clean and comfortable. We opted for a buffet breakfast each morning and the food was very varied,abundant and delicious.The staff were so well mannered and pleasant. I read a few comments about the Air con which I have to agree it was a bit noisy but to be honest each night when we returned to our room we were so exhausted we didn't even notice.And my kids wouldn't be happy if I didn't mention the roof top pool. They spent a very hot evening there swimming until it closed at 10.00pm and the entire time a member of staff was keeping an attentive eye on them which is reassuring.It was a good chance for them to meet other kids staying at the hotel. On the whole I would recommend the Holiday Inn Capitol. We are planning another trip to DC next year and we will definitely be booking our rooms there. On the whole I have to give a top mark review because as I hard as I try I can't think of anything negative ( and I am very fussy!)"

It's a block south of the Air & Space museum and the rest of the national mall. For me, it was a business trip and I didn't get to visit any of the museums. It was a short walk to the buildings where my meetings were located.The lobby of the Holiday Inn looks like it's been updated recently with a modern, clean motif. My room, on the other hand, looked old. The carpet was old. The furniture was old. It did have a flatscreen TV and new bedding. The corner room I had was small, but still had enough room for a desk and a mini fridge. There was free wifi, but as with most hotels, the connection was weak and spotty. The bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels. The strangest thing was how low the toilet was. It was almost like a kid-sized toilet.Starbucks is located in the lobby, but was crowded every morning. If you're looking for a quick bite and coffee in the morning, you're better off heading down the hall to the express deli, where you can get in and out in a fraction of the time and probably save a few dollars. There are also two restaurants on property. I didn't try either.They've got a small rooftop pool with several lounge chairs and tables.The hotel is pricey, but what you get is a great location. You're basically paying for the location, not the amenities or decor."

We got a non-smoking room with two double beds. We arrived in DC earlier than expected and both children were in desperate need of a wash-up and we needed to get our car parked so we could begin looking around. The Hotel staff was amazing, and found us a room we could check in to earlier. Our view over the courtyard was fun for the kids, because at night my husband and I could go downstairs for a drink, sit in the courtyard and be visible to our children from the window. The room was clean and perfect for what we needed it to be. The restaurant in the hotel is very pricey though, so if you're on a budget, I don't recommend eating there, there are so many other great venues nearby that are cheaper! There is a Starbucks right on the corner (horrible staff, don't visit this one unless you absolutely need a Starbucks fix), CVS and t-shirt vendor. The hotel is in walking distance of everything except the zoo, but the metro is literally across the street, so no sweat. Also, a hint to any visitors from out of town that like their wine or beer or cocktails: there are NO package stores anywhere near the hotel and the drinks in the bar are heavily watered down and very pricey. If you, like us, enjoy a nightcap after the babies go to bed, or just to have with an eat-in dinner of pizza in the room, BRING IT WITH YOU. The water is also very chlorinated and my kids couldn't get over the taste, so stock up on water bottles prior to checking in and put them in the room fridge. The only issue we had was that the pool was under construction upon our arrival and we weren't informed of this when we made reservations, the kids were pretty devastated. That aside, I'd stay here again and recommend it to anyone anytime. It's a great hotel, in a great location for a pretty decent price, considering. Even the parking here is cheaper than any of the other hotels, which is a plus, if you, like us, just wanted to leave the car there and walk everywhere!! Definitely coming back!!!"

We stayed there one night to see some sights in the area. The room and main areas were clean. The furniture in the room is worn (but clean). The overall appearance of our room was a bit dated; popcorn ceilings, wallpaper, the worn furniture. But the beds were fine and the bathroom was updated (although no fan in there so it got too steamy when showering). The location is great. It is about three short blocks to the National Air & Space Museum and all of the sights along the National Mall. We easily walked to all of the sights. Only downside to the location was at night and early morning it is pretty desolate because it is surrounded by office buildings. There weren't many great food choices within short walking distance. There was a Starbucks, McDonalds, and deli on the same street and some food carts. We booked through the Holiday Inn website and took advantage of their Park & Stay package. $5 more than their standard room rate and it includes parking in their garage (normally $35 + tax per night). We were able to leave the car there after we checked out until 5pm, which was a huge plus!I would probably stay closer to the White House for my next visit but this is a very good choice if you don't want to take the car or worry about public transportation and see all the sights."

The neighborhood isn't bad but its full of grey government buildings. The rooms are clean but average. The beds are comfortable but beware the night trains that rumble by and wake the light sleeper, especially if you on the side close to the railway track. Free wireless is nice to have. The workout room is small but reasonably well kept. Elevators can get crowded in the mornings, especially when the hotel is full of fellow conference attendees. The staff are friendly and helpful.

My company put me here for biz but I would never stay here on my own. Although the location is good there are other hotels in the area. The rooms are musty, dank and stinky. The whole hotel needs a facelift as the hallways are outdated the rooms are quite beat up. The bellhops are greedy and won't let you borrow there cart without tipping them $20 - totally uncalled for. The internet was very weak and the 'technician' they sent up to my room to help me figure out how to get the ethernet cord to work barely spoke english and probably doesn't even own a computer. The pizza hut located in the building is unmarked and for good reason - it's horrible. The restaurant is loud and like a college party every night. The tourist are here in drones and I can tell by their fanny packs, high pants, exposed maps and wandering eyes. Feels more like a train station depot then a hotel. Don't stay at this hotel if you have any standards whatsoever. Bleh.I stayed at this hotel for a conference for 2 nights. The rooms are average, it does have a smell of rooms that were once smoking rooms but no longer are(its bearable). My room was on the second floor right above the Prime 21restaurant/lounge, a live band plays Wednesday and Thursdays' and the noise does come through the floor of the room. It's not too bad they only play from 6pm to 9pm. The lounge does get very packed on those nights and the music is good (jazzy hip hop feel). The office of FEMA is connected to this hotel so there is a lot of people walking throughout the hotel. For you coffee lovers Starbucks is also connected to the hotel along with a CVS, cleaners and a few pizza and sub places. There is a nice patio area where you can eat your lunch unfortunately for me it rained every single day so i did not personally enjoy the patio.The Metro stop is about a block away."

It is in the perfect spot to walk to the Air and Space Museum, Mall, Capital and Washington Monument (although it was a bit of a hike from the Washington Monuent back to the hotel). We did not bother with a car to save some money as there was an additional fee of about $30 a night to park at the hotel. The Metro Rail is very close by and can get you to walking distance of some of the other attractions that are farther away from the hotel.The ""Pros"" of this hotel: - Location- short-walking distance to Air and Space Museum - It is clean, but as other reviewers have said, it is dated and could use some updating. Some tiles were cracked in the lobby. -The hotel restaurant isn't bad (Capital Bistro) and the buffet,  especially breakfast was good. Kids 12 and under get a $2.00 rate for the buffet, or free off the kids menu. -Pizza Hut Pizza made in the hotel by room service was just as good as going to a Pizza Hut Restraunt. pizza came to the room piping hot. -Good supply of towels in the bathroom, unlike some other hotels. -Housekeeping was on top of things, our room was always, done when we got back to the hotel after our travels. -Staff seemed polite, when passing in the hallway or when we needed a new battery for the tv remote. It was sent to the room in a matter of minutes by a pleasant, smiling man. -Was able to arrange our Monuments by Moonlight tour from the desk in the lobby, and the trolly picked us up right outside of the hotel.The ""Cons"" of this hotel: -There are train tracks right behind the hotel and you can hear the screeching of metal wheels on the tracks along with  the train whistle blowing at all hours of the day and night. Why they have to blow the whistle at 2, 3, or 4 in the morning is  beyond me,but it did wake us up. Our room faced the atrium and  we could still hear it quite clearly. (Not the hotel's fault) -The beds weren't really very comfortable. That may just be that the mattresses too are old and need replacing. -Didn't get a good night's sleep or feel very rested. -Two times we were approached right outside the hotel front door by people asking for money for food, and one time I was approached in the lobby near the business center for money for the subway. -Rooftop pool is small, and better suited for younger kids. -Some language barriers with the restaurant staff. My son wanted orange juice without pulp (which they have) but it depended on what waiter you got. One server brought him orange soda after several failed attempts to ask for the o.j. -There really aren't any restaurants nearby, besides a McDonalds and Quizno a few doors down. You have to go out of your way to find a restaurant, although the front desk did give us a list of restaurants within a mile or so of the hotel when we checked in. We went to the Hard Rock Cafe one night just because we were bored with the buffet and McDonalds, but we still had to walk a few blocks from the metro stop, and it cost us just under $100 for four of us to eat, 1 appetizer, 4  entrees, and sodas. (That was after using my AAA card for a discount). So it was almost worth it to eat at the hotel because, it was cheaper. The hard rock was on the ""lower price"" list of nearby places to eat. Can't imagine what an ""upscale"" restaurat would have cost. -Coin machine in the laundry room was out of order, and there  are only 4 washers which seemed to always be in use, but one was broke as was one dryer. -The elevator (outside the Capital Bistro Restaurant) is pretty small so it fills up quickly. Overall the main attraction of this hotel is location, location, location as they say. I would describe it as family friendly, clean and safe.Tip: The Monument by Moonlight Tour was very enjoyable. I would recommend it. If you can ask for a driver, we had Mr Holiday and he was fantastic.  If you want to see the other Air and Space Museum over at Dulles Airport you can take a Metro Bus to the airport for $6.00 per person (each way). Then a shuttle from IAD  to the museum for .50 cents per person (each way). It is a full day adventure and you have to time it well so the earlier you leave the better. The Air and Space Museum shuttle at Dulles only goes every 45 minutes and is a small shuttle bus that holds maybe 15 to 20 people. The driver said that it isn't uncommon to leave people behind beause the shuttle fills up. Especially the last one from the museum at the end of the day to the airport. If you miss that one or get left behind, you are on your own for transportation back to the airport. They don't send another shuttle. Just FYI, the food at most of the museums is ridiculously expensive. So much for ""free"" admission. Buy the time you feed a family of four, you've shelled out a pretty good chunk of change."

The hotel was just a short taxi ride from Union Station.The hotel is in a geat location to museum's and the Hop On Hop Off bus. This is caught outside the Air and Space Museum or the Trolly tour goes from outside the gift shop in the hotel lobby.There are no safes in the room but I had no trouble leaving my important documents in a safety deposit box at reception.Our room was always cleaned promptly.The hotel also has a laundry that is for guest's use at a small charge, but it's a lot cheaper than sending out your clothes all the time.The only thing that made it a bit hard was the lack of eating venues near the hotel. Sure there are some fast food oultlets near by, and the hotel food was good but sometimes you just like to have a greater choice.All in all we found the hotel staff friendly and as first time visitors to Washington DC were very pleased with our choice."

There's also a gift shop with some snacks, cigarettes, soda, etc.The only criticism i have is the room needs a bit of refurbishment. The arms of the desk chair were worn out and small pieces would come off when you touched it. The wallpaper in the shower was a little rough.Overall a good stay."

The whole room shook whenever a (very long) freight train passed by. So no sleep at all night one. Then moved to an upper floor on other side of hotel. Location surrounded by Government offices but within easy (10-30 mins) walk of all the big sights but you have to get public transport or cab to any restaurant or bar because the only place to eat within walking distance is hotel restaurant, a Starbucks attached to hotel or McDonalds next door. Modern rooms are typical holiday inn decor and proximity to Govt offices means lots of conference delegates. Serves great breakfasts but little else to commend. (Hotel evacuated on first evening for (false) fire alarm. So spent an hour on the street.)"

After reading the reviews, I wanted to change the reservations and wish that I would have.The first room we were given was only partially furnished and very dirty. The second room we were given had a queen bed and sofa bed, which is what we expected. However, it was not much cleaner than the first. There were many stains on the bed skirt and sofa. The carpet had food ground into it that could have been easily cleaned, if it had been properly vacuumed. There was a lot of dust in the window seal and on the furniture. The paint in the bathroom was peeling and the tile was cracked and dirty looking.Regarding the amenities. The refrigerator controls were missing and just barely kept our food below room temperature. The little freezer in the refrigerator was not cold enough to keep our freezer packs frozen. When the air conditioner cut on it was so loud that you could not hear the television. One of the lamps was missing the lightbulb. The alarm clock / lamp had an electrical short. Whenever you touched the lamp, the clock quit working. There was a power strip located between the head of the bed and the nightstand. It was a tangled mess.Finally, the fire alarm went off one afternoon. As we started down the fire escape staircase with my handicap son (who moves very slowly on stairs), we were met by a chef coming up the stairs. He immediately took a hold of my son and practically carried him down two flights of stairs. When we reached the lobby, another employee brought over a chair for my son to use. They explained that the alarm had gone off on the 5th floor and even though no actual fire was found, it was being investigated. After the all clear from the fire department, we were able to return to our rooms. A letter was posted in all of the elevators stating that the system had “malfunctioned”."

City noise, thin walls.-Amenities ok-Price: Moderate to a little high, but worth it for the location-Value: Good.LOCATION: Sightseeing was great esp traveling with a little one in a stroller. It is within7 minutes walking distance to the capitol building, the mall, and museums (Air/Space, Native American, Natural History, Art, National Archives and ice skating). So the sites were easy to get to, come back for a nap, and easy to go back to. It is a long walk to the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials as well as the Washington Monument (needle), but doable. DINING: Downstairs in the hotel there is a Starbucks, a little store, a restaurant, and a shoppette all with high prices. HOWEVER, the we found the $14 breakfast buffet a good value b/c it offered fresh fruit, a variety of well prepared foods and our daughter ate for free. We got a solid breakfast to head out for the day. Outside, just a few steps away is a CVS pharmacy where you can buy snacks/meds. A few steps from that is a Quizno's and a few steps more there is a McDonald's. We couldn't find a good sitdown restaurant so we drove out of DC for dinners.ROOM: 2-3 stars. Dated and worn, but functional. Its the tradeoff for a good location. Our room was 4th floor above the entrance so we caught all the tour buses down below that were either delivering new patrons from the airport or taking them to it. Thin walls.FITNESS: They have a fitness room, but jogging around the mall area was much more fun. About a half block away from the hotel was a curbside fitness area with pull up and sit up stations so runners could catch some of that action on the way in from a run.RECOMMEND: Book a Holiday Inn package that includes parking. You save a little on the room, your parking is paid for and you forego the hassle of keeping track of parking meter tickets, etc.If you're budget/time/amenity conscious and want to spend 1-3 days touring the Smithsonian museums this is a great location for the traveling family. With a Holiday Inn parking pkg forget parking, forget the metro and spend time enjoying the sights."

We chose this place for the location and the free internet. There was free internet, BUT we couldn’t get wireless in the room. Only the lobby. There was a wired connection in the room, but I brought my old laptop without an Ethernet port. So anytime I needed to use the internet, I had to the lobby. The location is great IF you’re focusing on the museums. It’s still a decent walk to the Capitol and monuments. There is a CVS nearby, BUT it closes at 7pm to my shock. Check in was smooth and receptionists were nice, although they couldn’t get us in our room til actual check in time. It’s near a subway stop, so that makes it convenient. Pool was small and crowded and you do get a peek at the capitol IF you’re out of the pool. It’s not as great as others have made it out to be. We used the $2 off breakfast buffet coupons. It was adequate, but without much variety. Even for a hotel restaurant, it was overpriced. I never went inside the bar, but people appeared to have a good time. The room itself was what I expected. The bathroom was fairly spacious. Towels and cups were replenished fully. I can’t compare this to other hotels in DC, as this was my first, but I cannot imaging paying close to $300 a night for a room here even in DC."

We should have known there might be problems, when we phoned 2 weeks ago to try and request a room at the front of the building, away from the railroad tracks we saw on google map, and the woman who answered told my husband, ""I don't know what you want-transfer"", which connected him with someone in another country for reservations.He phoned 2 more times and was told that they had reserved a room for us, not on the train side. Can you guess where the room was? 7 floors above the L'Enfant train station, with 3 rows of tracks. Toot toot! Chuga chuga chuga chuga..every 20 minutes. Great for train enthusiasts, but not for folks road weary, in need of rest. When we expressed disappointment, they gave us 2 breakfast buffet passes - that's another story.The 7th floor hall was perfumed and musty smelling. My first concern was that a guest had brought a candle, but then I realized the whole place smelled that way. The room decor was dated, with stained, damp smelling, scratched furniture. The standing lamp, embedded in the curtains, could only lean, not stand on its own, with a wobbly shade. The old tv had 20 satellite channels. The toilet seat and tub had pubic hairs. Very small closet. We had been in the room for 2 minutes, when there was a knock-knock-the door unlocked and opened- a maid appeared to see if there was anything we needed. I thought, ""privacy would be nice"", but instead mentioned that we were waiting on a maintenance person to come and replace the inoperative refridgerator. After she got a good look at our stuff, she left. The door knocked again, this time the repairman kindly allowed US to open the door. He told us they set the fridges on timers, to conserve electricity. He set the timer on the back and said, ""No, it's not the timer, this fridge is broke"". So, out he goes, in search of a new one. A few minutes go by, we're trying to get things settled, when our new acquaintance, the maid, knocks, unlocks and enters our room to see if we ""got the fridge thing worked out"". We said yes, then double bolted the door. THAT seemed to keep her out, because the room was never adequately cleaned again for the next 3 days. When we got our ""new"" fridge, the timer ticked so loudly, we decided to just go with the cooler we had brought - doing our part to conserve electricity!The bed has one sheet and a thin blanket. When we arrived, one bed had a small 16 inch wide coverlet, the other didn't. Next night, wow, both beds had the coverlet. Third night, no coverlets.The pool and its surrounds are so small and cramped, we got to witness 3 pool toys go over the side, during our onetime visit to the glorified public bathtub.The Capitol Cafe: decorated in a sterile, sticky, mid-century modern style, offering over warmed, over priced food, by an apparently disgruntled staff. Our waitress, for some reason while walking by our table, (she never stopped AT our table to check on us), would emit very loud, sighs and humphs. We saw a couple of the busboys make strange hand gestures, that did not seem friendly, to each other, perhaps some sort of modified ""flipping of the bird"". It was not a very hospitable experience. The cashier was upset that we hadn't mentioned to the waitress that we had free food vouchers. No where on them, did it state that we were supposed to put anyone on alert. We'd of been hard pressed to tell her, since she ignored us the whole time. We did not go to the restaurant bar.The ""24 hour Business Center"" stayed busy at all hours, with under aged, long time You Tubing hotel guests; no chance to check my email. There are signs stating no one under 18 could be there,with a 30 minute limit, but as I heard one woman, working on her ""Mother of the Year"" nomination tell her 10 year old, ""You're not getting on any bad sights are you? (child grunted a negative reply) Well then stay down here until someone kicks you out"". There is a Quiznos, always busy Starbucks and a McDonald's on this block. That's it. Hotels on the north side of the mall have a lot of great choices for meals out, including about 20 places in the food court at Union Station. So, get used to riding the Metro for meals. Or better yet, find a hotel on that side. This hotel is probably good for people with groups of school children who tear up the facility anyway and don't want to take the metro to go to the Smithsonian. Or perhaps, folks from 3rd world nations who have lowered expectations. This is not a good place for someone who wants to stay in a clean, quiet place with friendly, happy employees who take pride in their work."

The rate wasn't too bad...I booked from their website and paid about $120/night on the weekend. I was a little leary about our room location, since it looked down on the Amtrak, but we weren't bothered by noise at all. The only noise that was bothersome, was the staff in the hallway outside our room. The building across the street provides easy access to the metro. However, on our return trip from Arlington, we got turned around and it was a bit of a walk back. We wanted to check out the rooftop pool (around 9pm), but the door was locked and we couldn't get up there. Disappointing since I thought the view of Washington would be great from up there. Parking is under the building...you have to check in first, and they will give you a card to present to the guard at the lot. There really is no restaurants nearby....a Starbuck's downstairs, the hotel bar/restaurant, that kind of thing, but for dinner we had to drive a few minutes away. Overall, I would say this hotel was about average, but with a fabulous location."

The hotel is in the perfect location for visiting all the attractions and because of all the government buildings is also in a safe area with lots of security around. As per other reviews there is a lack of resturants nearby but with the metro 1 1/2 blocks away who cares as you can go somewhere for dinner with ease!!! (Just a hint thought get off at the Maryland street exit not L'Enfant Plaza like we did for the hotel go up the esclators turn right walk down to the traffic lights, cross over, turn right again and the hotel is one block up)The room itself was quite large, we had four suitcases and hand luggage and had plenty of space to move, it has a mini fridge which is great as there is a CVS two doors down so we were able to buy cereal and milk for breakfast which saved some money, otherwise the Shuttle express deli does breakfast and so does McDonalds. We had no problems at all with the staff even when mum took the service elevator by mistake and was wandering around the back areas of the hotel, the staff showed her the way out and were lovely and friendly.Just a note with the dryers in the laundry, you have to ""slam"" the door hard to get them to start."

Plenty of seating and beds though. Gym is small and equipped with mostly bikes and treadmills though there are free weights and one weights machine.I had a buffet breakfast in the restaurant each day and this was excellent.I also used the safety deposit box service at reception and found this easy to use.All staff were very good.The hotel is in a very good location. There is a railroad alongside which keeps going with freight trains 24-hours but I got used to this quickly and it didn't cause me any problems.Would certainly use again.

Read loads of reviews on this hotel and decided it was in the right location.Firstly about the location, it's excellent for sightseeing. Close to the National Mall, all the Museums and 5 mins walk from L'Enfant Plaza Metro station. You can buy an all day ticket for $7.80 per person (after 9:30 during the week and any time weekends and public holiday). It is a very safe area as it is near all the Government buildings so security is tight, which is reassuring. There are little or no restaurants nearby, so if you want a nice place to eat it's a tube ride away, which I didn't find a problem.The hotel itself. Standard Holiday Inn really. Nice big rooms. I made sure I was not overlooking the railway line as I was warned by previous reviews this might be a problem. Was in room 362, overlooking the courtyard, which was quiet. I am a platinum Priority Club member but could not get a room upgrade (same problem in NY too in Feb). The beds are incredibly comfy and there is the usual Holiday Inn pillow menu, which I never use as they always seem to provide the right pillow for me first time. There is a fridge in the room and we liked the huge pile of towels in the clean bathroom.We used Supershuttle for a transfer from Washington Dulles Airport, so did not park at the hotel, but understand it to be quite pricey (a lot less than London though).Public areas. Very clean, lots of marble and never crowded, with a small gift shop which is also slightly pricey. There is a CVS store next door which is much cheaper, but keeps to business hours so closes early and is not open Sundays.Hotel facilities. There is a breakfast dining room called Smithonian, which provides a fair variety. I was travelling with my son and we were given some $2 off vouchers. Kids eat free is 12 or under. We ordered the breakfast buffet every day which is $15 a day. My son is 14, but they kept giving me his breakfast for $2 so didn't complain (they obviously thought he was 12). The quality of breakfast was OK, lots of coffee, Orange Juice, there's fresh fruit, cooked items, cereals etc.Bar. There is a bar that has live music playing on Weds-Fri eves. This makes it very popular with the locals and it does pack out. The music is excellent quality though and well worth a listen. Drinks are expensive, as you expect for a hotel in this location. A standard 1/2 pt beer is about $6. The bar has an outside on-street terrace, which is nice if you find the bar too cold (due to aircon) but is near the road and train line so can be a little noisy)There is a business centre that is free to use, which is handy for checking e-mails while away and doing your online check-in for your flight home. There is a rooftop pool, which is accessed by going to level 9 by lift then taking a staircase to the roof. The pool is small but clean and there are loads of loungers, which we found really nice at the end of the day, after a day walking the sights. There is a nice view of the Capitol building and the roof is a great sun-trap. There is no bar or services up there, so you need to take your own drinks etc., which you can buy from the vending machines on each floor (there is also ice on each floor). The pool is open 10am until 10pm.Overall if you want a functional hotel, near the sights then you can't go too far wrong with this one."

After staying there for five nights, I disagree. Yes, the location was close to some of the tourist sites. (It is only a block and a half from the National Air and Space Museum.) But it is located right in the middle of all of these ugly cement government buildings. FEMA is right next door. The Dept. of Ed. is across the street. So, the location is actually kind of odd. The problem with that is that there are no restaurants close by except Quiznos and McDonalds. That was a big disappointment. We didn't have a car, so we had to take the subway to get to any decent restaurant. We went on a tour of the city, and found that the area around Ford's Theater/the Spy Museum is actually the better spot to stay. Many more restaurants, lots of other hotels. I liked the rooftop pool at the Holiday Inn, but it was small, so most of the time it was completely crowded with young children. We were within a decent walking distance to the Capitol building, so that was nice. We also walked all the way to the Lincoln Memorial and back--but that was a really long walk. Internet access was free, which was nice. But the other annoying thing about the room was the air conditioner. In order to cool down the room, the air conditioner ran on high ""arctic blast"" (as we called it) and froze whoever was sitting at the desk. So, all in all, it was an okay hotel. The location was close to the National Mall, but far from any restaurants. It did have a pool, but it was too small. The price was expensive for what you got."

Although I was aware of the fact that it was in a business area, and that there was virtually no night-life there, I preferred being near the Mall, where most of the tourist attractions are located.The hotel itself is about average (perhaps a bit above), and was packed with tourists, mainly families. Service was fine, although I found that the dining options (except for breakfast) were not really that good.Rooms were standard for Holiday Inn, well kept, and clean, although the windows can not be opened, and the air-conditioner was a bit noisy (which was most obvious at night).The location is extremely convienient for tourists... literally a 3 minute walk to the Air and Space Museum, and about 10 to the Capitol. True, you have to travel to find good restaurants in the evenings, but the Metro station is right nearby, and it seemed quite safe and efficient, even late at night.If you have a car and come on the weekend (when the room rates were actually cheaper), you can park outside of the hotel for free (instead of using the hotel's garage, which costs $25 a day) - there is an abundance of parking in the street.Be sure to ask for a room that does not face the rail tracks, since the noise is really a nusance (my room faced the inner court which was very quiet and nice).I would definately go back to this hotel in the future."

This was it! We were thrilled with how close this hotel was to everything we wanted to see. (Just a few blocks from many of the Smithsonian Sites. It was just one block away from the ""L'Enfant"" Metro stop. We even decided to take the metro to get to Reagan International Airport , just a few stops away from ours. $1.35 per ride rather than the $12 + dollars for the taxi ride. (I know this because we took a taxi when we arrived fearful that it would be too difficult to find our hotel and deal with our bags.) The only surprise to our stay was the lack of restaurants near the hotel. We decided to check out Georgetown (take the circulator bus $1.00/ride)and the Dupont Circle (Easy Metro Access $1.35 per ride) areas. Both locations had plenty of restaurants to choose from."

There were a few negatives (discussed below), but many positives.We made our reservations in February and obtained a $136 per night rate with a AAA discount. I believe the rates were low for the week because Congress was in recess for the Fourth of July. I booked through the hotel website.The Hotel has 9 stories and is arranged in a C shape, with courtyard in the interior of the C. The hotel has a connection to the lobby of the FEMA office building next door. There are no guest rooms on the ground floor. We were given room 949, near the southwest corner of the top floor.There are four elevators off the main lobby to serve the guest rooms. The elevators were quick – we rarely had to wait more than 30 seconds for a car to come. There is one additional elevator near the restaurants on the ground floor. That elevator was very slow to move between the floors. The wait for the single elevator could be a few minutes and the car was often full.We had a room with two double beds. The beds were very comfortable – we slept well. The mattress was firm, the pillows were comfortable. The bathroom had considerable counter space and a tub with shower. The shower was high enough (I am 6’3” and it was above my head) and delivered a strong flow of hot water. One drawback in the bathroom was the lack of a fan to try to vent the steamy, hot air from the shower. The bathroom area was clean.The room has an air conditioning unit by the window, but it is controlled by a thermostat on the wall far from the unit. We had some difficulty keeping the room cool due to the windows facing the southwest and the room receiving direct sunlight during the afternoon and evening. We were never able to freeze the room down to what I consider an ideal sleeping temperature around 68, but I had only one night where I felt warm. There is an air flow guide on the unit that directs the air towards the room and away from the window. The drawback is that sitting at the desk in the room, you get the air directly on you. The desk is the coldest part of the room.We had very few concerns with noise in the room. The air conditioning unit provides a white noise that muffles most outside sound. Early in the morning right before waking up, I did hear a few trains going by on the tracks that run along the back of the hotel, but I was never awaken by noise from the trains. I also heard no noise from the hallways or the adjacent rooms.Rooms had a small refrigerator, coffee maker and hair dryer. There was no in room safe and no microwave. The refrigerator was great for beverages – there is a CVS near the hotel that has water and other drinks – cheaper than hotel vending machines. Bring your own if you are driving to the hotel.The location of the hotel is a selling point. Only two blocks from the Air & Space Museum and the National Mall. Most of the attractions are within walking distance. With all the museums offering free admission, it is easy to head back to the hotel for a midday rest or lunch as it is just a short walk back.The hotel is located between 1 and 2 blocks from the L’Enfant Plaza Metro stop – 4 of the 5 lines on the Metro stop here (only the Red Line does not serve L’Enfant Plaza). The L’Enfant Plaza station is a large station with four exits. Make sure you use either the 7th & Maryland or 7th & D Street exits to access the hotel. The hotel is at 6th & C. If you use the 7th & Maryland, continue walking straight ahead off the Metro escalators and turn right at the corner of Maryland & 6th. If you exit at the 7th & D Street exit, do a U turn when you leave and then turn right. Go to the traffic light and turn left, go under the railroad tracks and the hotel is on the right. Do NOT exit at the other exits from the Metro at this station. We learned the hard way our second night at the hotel. We exited after sunset and could not see our hotel and were very disoriented for a few minutes as we were a few blocks away from where we had previously exited. While nothing unsafe, being in an unfamiliar place with very few people out and about at night is not a comfortable feeling. All the exits are well marked in the station.The hotel has a guest laundry that proved invaluable for our stay. Located on the second floor, the laundry has 4 washers and 6 dryers. $1 per load for each. Laundry detergent is available in small boxes for 75 cents each. CVS also offers laundry supplies. The sign says about 30 minutes a load for the washer, but our loads were usually done in about 20 minutes. There were occasions we had to wait for a washer to become available. And waiting for someone to come on empty a washer was frustrating. A weak point of the hotel is the food selection. The hotel has three choices – A restaurant, a lounge and a snack bar. The snack bar has sandwiches and Pizza Hut pizzas – but closes each day at 5:30. The $11 pizza during the day becomes an $18 room service pizza after 5:30 due to delivery charges and mandatory 18% gratuity.The restaurant had both a breakfast buffet and a dinner buffet each day we were there. The kids eat free promotion entitles kids to $3.00 off the buffets. Breakfast buffet was good – nice selection, free juice and coffee and reasonably priced. The dinner buffer was $16.95 when we arrived, $17.50 by the time we left. Kids dinner buffet was $6.95, $3.95 with the kids eat free coupon. Dinner buffet food was mediocre at best. I did not see much difference between the quality there and at a Ryan’s or Old Country Buffet – just a much higher price. They have pizza on the buffet for the kids and a nice salad bar.The best food we found in the hotel was at the lounge – but $12 is steep for a cheeseburger and fries, especially for a family. As others have noted the surrounding area does not have a lot of restaurant choices. The FEMA building next door has a Quizno’s, Wall Street Deli and McDonald’s. If you go to the nearby Air & Space, McDonald’s is their food vendor, but the prices are jacked up by about $3 on each value meal – leave and go to the McDonald’s near the hotel and save some $. There is a Vie De France restaurant in the office building across the street. We tried it one night. Slow, inattentive service and mediocre food keep me from recommending Vie De France.The lobby is spacious. We did not use the concierge service in the lobby, but many did. We made tour reservations for Old Town Trolley through the gift shop. The Trolley comes to the hotel to pick you up. The worst part of the trip was check-in. We arrived around 7:00, after a day of flight delays and had hoped to arrive, check-in, hop on the Metro for dinner and to go grocery shopping. We were told we could not check-in as the computer “had just gone down.” Amazingly there was no back-up plan. We quickly learned that the system had been down for about 30 minutes and there were several others waiting around to check-in as well. All the front desk personnel suggested was giving our luggage to the bell captain and going to the lounge to wait. Management dropped the ball here – both by not having a backup plan and by not offering any compensation of any kind to those affected. A voucher for the restaurant or lounge would have been appropriate. No updates of any kind were given and about 20 minutes later there was a mad stampede to check-in when they simply started processing check-ins again. It took a few minutes to find a room for us – we needed the two double beds and they tried to give us a room with a single bed. I have no idea what the hotel would have done if their computer did not come back up. Check-out was smooth. Two copies of our bill were slipped under the door at night. We signed the second copy and dropped it in a box in the lobby with our keys. Surprisingly we could not check our bill on the TV in the room. This is the first hotel in a long time that I have not been able to check my bill. I had to carefully check my bill due to the number of room charges from the restaurant and room service. I prefer to charge those separately to ensure that I am not overcharged as I rush to checkout. Our bill was accurate and the checkout was smooth.The first floor has a business center with four computers and a printer. There is no charge for either and there were no restrictions on printing – although you need to go to the front desk when it runs out of paper. They do ask you to limit your use to 30 minutes. There is a sign that says the computers are only for guests over 18, but it was not enforced.The lobby has wireless service; the rooms have wired high speed access. The high speed in the room was fast – we had an issue where we could not connect for about 24 hours. The hotel maintenance came quickly to work on it and put me in touch with their provided. We eventually got it straightened out.We were at the hotel for the Fourth of July fireworks on the National Mall. Due to rain during the day, we waited until about an hour before the fireworks to head over. An employee of the hotel was in the lobby handing out large trash bags to sit on – very nice and a great idea. We walked over and breezed right through security and had a great time watching the fireworks. 10 minutes after they were over, we were back in our room. The hotel had a “barbeque” after the wireworks. At prices that would make ballparks blush, we passed on hamburgers and hot dogs.Lots of good about this hotel – clean, quiet, comfortable rooms, fantastic locations, good business amenities. Overall the rating is dragged down by overpriced, mediocre food service. But I will return if I can get a reasonable enough rate.The Holiday Inn Capitol certainly has a lot going for it. After staying in a wonderful hotel in NYC for a few days (Affinia 50--highly recommended), my brother and I thought we would be taking a huge step down in quality etc...not so. The Room--a pretty spacious one compared to many, with a good tv (remote worked well, sound good, loads of channels), two very comfortable beds with a pillow menu (very Affinia mind you), great air conditioning-though the unit looks old, it's controlled from a modern digital wall unit and can make the room absolutely freezing or roasting, very useful. The bathroom is spacious and, most importantly, clean with a very nice powerful shower and nice soaps too. Maid service was very efficient and cleaned the room thoroughly. It was great to see not just a mini fridge, but a full fridge in the room, with nothing in it, no overpriced alcohol or anything!! Though one could hear some noise out in the corridor or from other rooms during the day, at night the hotel is silent, like from about 8pm, great for a good night's sleep. There wasn't a safe in our room but the ones beside/behind reception were useful, and the number of front desk staff meant I never had to wait for more than a minute to access it before going out.The Hotel: a modern, spacious lobby with all the usual stuff plus a lot of more unusual stuff too. The hotel has a Starbucks right off the lobby which is very usual, a gift shop/general shop open to 10pm daily, two restaurants and a deli style place. The business center, open 24 hours and only accessible with a room key, offers free, yes free, internet and printers etc.Though it's sometimes busy due to this fact, not paying or having to get a prepaid card or whatever was very refreshing.Restaurants nearby include Quiznos, Mcdonalds, Wall Street Deli, and a Vie de France, and there is a CVS right beside the hotel for fridge supplies. It's true that there aren't many great restaurants near the hotel but taxis, right outside, are very cheap for most destinations as they work by zone fees, not meters.I recommend Charlie Palmer Steak (1st and Constitution) for a great night...quiet, great service, great food, reasonable prices.The location of the hotel for sightseeing is great, steps to the Mall, Capitol etc, and L'Enfant Plaza station (the biggest metro station by line number) is great for Archives, White House, Spy Museum, Holocaust Museum, and it's two steps away.We never used the pool on the roof but many others seemed to enjoy it, though I understand it's not too deep.The hotel , interestingly, has guest laundry facilities on the second floor, i.e. dryers and washers, which are cheap, secure and very useful if you would rather not use the hotel's laundry service.We used both and obviously one was much cheaper (hotel service was $70, guest ones $3).We didn't eat in the restaurants, we prefer to leave the hotel at night, but they looked nice and not overly expensive and the Pizza Hut pizzas offered in the Shuttle Express Deli were popular.LIve jazz was very popular in the 21st Amendment Bar and Grill when it was on.Free USA Today was a nice touch too. Ice, soda on every floor.Overall, the Holiday Inn Capitol served us very well.For the rate we got via hotel's website, our stay were above expectations.The rooms were nice, clean and well air conditioned, the hotel was in a great location and had above average amenities. If you want a pleasant stay along with a location set up for sightseeing and more sightseeing, then I'd go with this place. Yea the Willard looked nice, but huge credit card bills aren't and they may not have a pillow menu."

We were lucky to be able to afford this place. Considering it was Cherry Blossom week, I do think it was worth the price. Here are some details:Overall: Pros: Great ""neighborhood"". The hotel is in the federal building ocean that is around the National mall, the FEMA building is attached to the hotel. It is 3 very short blocks from the Air and Space museum and a ""circulator"" stop. It is also a very short walk through a building, to the L'Enfant Plaza Metro stop. The staff was helpful, check-in and out was easy. There was an elevator under repair, but we never waited for an elevator more than a minute or so. Very fast. Oh and there's a full-service Starbucks in the lobby.Cons: There are train tracks about 100 yards from the hotel that if you are sensitive to noise, might interfere with sleeping. Also, finding food after 6pm was an issue. The hotel restaurant hours were good, but the food was only fair. For daytime eating, there are lots of options close by, but the sidewalks roll up at about 6pm. So eat early or plan on taking the Metro. Hotel will provide you with a list of some restaurants, but none are really close enough to walk to that are ""nice"" restaurants. The parking garage is very cramped and very difficult to navigate. We parked our car and then didn't move it again.Room:Pros: spacious, lots of outlets, many options for lighting. Air conditioning will set icicles on you if you sit at the desk while it's on. Whew! Very powerful. There's a fridge. We were unable to make the wireless network connection work all the time, but used the cat5 connection without too much difficulty. The free connection speed was PLENTY fast. Bed was comfortable, pillows were firm. Maid service was excellent. Iron was very good.Cons: had to walk a hundred miles to the drink and ice machine.Bathroom: Pros: Tons of counter space, GREAT water pressure, excellent maid service.Cons: none, really."

Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a Queen size bed and a pull out couch. (For some odd reason, we both noticed a slight maple scent to the towels. It was very pleasant, but rather odd!) The toiletries are Bath & Bodyworks products. Housekeeping was good and the room was very clean. The bed was comfy, and they offered to get us other pillows if we wanted firmer or softer pillows. Our room looked out over a charming courtyard with trees, plants and tables with yellow and red umbrellas. One of the best parts of the hotel was it's convenient location. We were a block and a half away from the Metro, and the same distance from the Air & Space Museum. We were able to use the business center to print out our boarding passes for our return flight. We never used the pool or the any of the restaurants. On the same block there is a McDonald's, a Quiznos, a deli and a CVS. There is a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone traveling to DC."

We walked from the hotel to Capitol Hill, Union Station, White House and Washington Monument. Very convenient for visiting Smithsonian museums.The room was clean, well equipped and comfortable. The free high-speed internet connection is very appreciated and frankly I will not consider a hotel that will not get me online for free.Didn't try the breakfast buffet, but the hotel restaurant was fine and the free childrens menu satisfied my 8 y.o. There's a quick option for breakfast if you're not interested in a sit-down meal. Staff was helpful and friendly. They feature a 2:00pm checkout which was also convenient for us. I recommend asking for a courtyard facing room to avoid noise of adjacent train tracks.My rate for two double beds was $99/night. I'll definately stay there again and will use it as headquarters when I bring the other rugrats.The attached photographs of the hotel and Air & Space museum were taken from the same spot to demonstrate how close the hotel is to the Mall."

As a female solo traveler I felt very safe in this hitel/location. the room was nice sized, great smart TV, in room mini bar, and comfy bed, bathrobes and hair dryer in the bathroom along with complimentary tolietries. the bathroom was large and modern and clean- loved the glass walk in shower. I was on the 8th floor & had a bit of a nice view of the water/dock, which was a plus. did not eat in the hotel restuarant as the menu did not appeal to me, but luckily there are many great restaurants both fair priced and expensive within walking distance. I tried room service one night since I liked the menu more. Pretty decent but high priced as expected. It is about a mile walk to the National Mall and museums which I enjoyed. there is a self -park parking garage basically attached the the hotel for 35.00 a day. There's a cvs nearby for beverages and even some snacks and fresh, cold food (fruit/cheese). The only thing I didn't love was that my room did not have a do not disturb sign, so housekeeping came in each day.I didnt see any signs on any other doors in my hall. Housekeeping did a nice job, but I would have opted out 1 or 2 days since I was alone. Overall, the hotel location, cleanliness and friendly staff make it a 5 star hotel snd I will stay here again."

Lovely new mid size rooms. There’s a good crispy chicken sandwich in the bar and highly inventive cocktail menu. Top level service and friendly smiles all around.I loved the location at the Wharf. The room, and service however were just ok. We had called repeatedly ahead of time asking about early check in. We were told nothing could be promised until the day of arrival. We called again before we boarded our plane in New York, and still got no commitment. As we checked in around 12, we were told they’d call/text in an hour or so, when it was ready. After 2.5 hours of wandering around, no call comes. We eventually make our way back, and assert ourselves to get a room. As we checked in, we asked for a ‘fridge as we learned there isn’t one in the room. The room itself, looked a little beaten up, and was not very big. The best part was its view of the Potomac and it’s proximity to the Wharf and all the shops and restaurants. Beyond that, the ‘fridge needed to be asked for 3x. We came back one day at 4:00 and the room was still being cleaned. Another day, rubber gloves were left on our dresser. While no one item was a big deal, the whole of our experience added up to being just ok.Check in was smooth. They tried to get us a room as quickly as possible although we had arrived prior to 4pm. The staff was friendlyElevators are a bit strange, you kind of had to hit 2 buttons because the 2 on the left are separate from the 1 on the right (the one on the right goes to the rooftop pool which it was too cold to try).Our room was nice and spacious. Each room comes with a Nespresso. They give the usual toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion.While we were there, we heard the music from the wedding through the floor. We were on the 4th floor so word to the wise. The hotel was good about moving us to another floor but it is bad that a hotel has poor sound insulation like that. The area around the hotel is cool. I recommend Kith/Kin for dinner-usually reservations book up quickly here so I would book on Opentable several weeks ahead. Also, I had an amazing breakfast at Toastique which was around the corner."

We didn't arrive until late in the afternoon. At check in there were 3 staff, 2 were on the phone and 1 was hovering. We stood and waited for her to greet us, she didn't. Once the other member of staff had finished she kindly greeted us. But she then answered a phone call while still trying to talk to us, then had a little tantrum when she realised someone had took her pen! Great impression so far... We had a room on the 12th floor which is were the conference rooms are and weddings are held. Our room was big and looked like it hadn't been used much. We had a large balcony that over looked other apartments. The balcony had no chairs to sit outside and looked partly finished. We visited the Roof top bar which in the evening is lovely and a great view but expensive. All good so far....until 6am!!We were woke up with a loud noise coming from a slaming door. There is a door occupied by housekeeping staff early in the morning. It is used continuously. It slams shut every time staff go in and out. This went on and on all morning. We were exhausted. We reported it to reception and she said they would sort it. On our return to the hotel much later in the day we were looking forward to a power nap since we were woke up so early. We were in for a complete shock. Once the elevator doors opened we were confronted with a very noisy wedding party. Oh it just got better. We fought our way through the party to get to our hopefully quiet room to nap!. Once in the room we knew it would be impossible. It was so noisy. We couldn't understand why they have bedrooms on this floor with function facilities. We contacted the manager on duty Scott immediately and told him everything. He was sympathetic and very quick sorting our situation out. We had to repack everything and we were moved to the seventh floor. Our room was lovely and over looked the marina. The rooms are lovely but you can hear noises coming from other rooms. They arent very well constructed. When housekeeping are doing their job early, every time they go in and out of a room they let the doors slam. There is no need for that to happen. For our issues we had during our stay, Scott offered us a voucher for the restaurant, which was greatly appreciated. The door men, Michael on Concierge are lovely and helpful. Check in staff could learn a lesson from them.."

We came into the room to champagne and strawberries as I mentioned it was my friends very special birthday hence the trip to DC and NYC, which was a lovely gesture. Ashley checked us in and mentioned they hold the FULL amount of your stay (6 nights for us), AND $150 for EACH night. I was not happy about that, so I told her so. She was very nice about it and said she would take our stay plus $300 instead of what should have been $900 ! So on with our holiday. The area is just superb, with 3 hotels, lots of gorgeous restaurants, live music, swings and the seafood market. We loved all of it and ate in the restaurants too (separate reviews for them). We had cocktails in the hotel (amazing) but no food. We met lots of nice staff and are now friends with some of the guests. Breakfast, first few days Sarah was marvellous at it ! Then it went downhill, the other days we would have to ask for orange juice (which was included with our breakfast), we had to ask for milk / cream for our coffee, sometimes butter, and once a spoon, and sometimes we had to ask twice. Staff were very pleasant but it’s annoying asking all the time for things that are included in your package. The room was amazing, and as two ladies we loved the vanity unit to sit and put your make up on. I missed a mirror in the bedroom. We had a view facing the Potomac River, just fabulous. We took the water taxis to National Harbour and went to Tanger Outlet, brilliant if you like shopping. The water taxis leave just outside the hotel, $18 return, and we also took one to a Georgetown. We ate in Del Mar, Kirwans Irish, Kaliwa and our favourite Lupo Marino. I have given the hotel 4 stars as it was amazing ! Some people would maybe give 1 star after the hassle I had, but up to the day I left for NYC we did have a ball ! I received a message while waiting for our bus to NYC from my CC company saying I had went overdrawn. I was very upset and wondered what went wrong. To cut a long stressful story short, the hotel took our 6 nights from my card, but they also had a HOLD on £2700 (POUNDS not dollars) on my card. After 3 nights £900 dropped from the hold but still £1800 was kept. I was emailing the reservations manager twice daily ( I was only in NYC for 4 nights) with NO sorry, just that they were trying to sort it out. In the 4 nights I was in NYC I could NOT use my card ! I came home yesterday and the £1800 was still on my card !!!! I have also never heard anything from the hotel. The hold was on from Sunday 26th until Saturday 1st September. Finally the hold came off today !! I will go back to DC and The Wharf but it won’t be The Intercontinental !"

Lucky bundle deals were still reasonably priced. The location was actually pretty good. Intercontinental is within walking of the mall towards the Washington monument side. The water is right outside the front door which is lined with plenty of places to dine. Beware of the price you will have to pay for anything in this area. There is a great place for coffee next door. Water taxis to Alexandrea leave from 100 meters away and Ubers were abundant in the area. The bus stop was convenient as well, just a left out the side door.I understand the Wharf is the latest IT thing in DC. I understand it’s summer and the District is busy with tourists. I do not understand the 1970s Vegas look.Seeking a nice, relaxing night away from home, we thought we’d use our IHG Ambassador night for a little staycation. We love the Willard but decided to try the new Intercontinental. The two cannot be more dissimilar!! The comfort, class, and style so evident at the Willard is no where to be seen. From a tiny check-in area and no room to wait at valet to a noisy balcony and no ice in the ice machine, we felt we were at a Holiday Inn. Traffic was atrocious and took us 30 minutes to go two blocks. Who in Gods green earth approved the TINY side streets?! Too many people, too many cars, no police, security chatting together and not helping anyone, Kith and Kit told us a one-hour wait that turned out to be two and a half hours, buildings so close people on rooftops looked into our room when I opened the balcony door, people on top of people, a bathroom mirror mounted for someone 4’5” tall, and too soft beds. The developers tried to squeeze every inch out of this place and you can tell. The turnarounds can hardly accommodate an SUV.It felt cheap and not Intercontinental quality. One of my worst stays at any IHG property.We will absolutely NOT be back.I recommend going to the Willard instead.- Spire Elite member"

As a hotel it is very good..valet parking was easy & fast, well worth the $55 overnight for the convenience (for our group anyway). Front desk was not as welcoming as I thought they could be - for a lot of guests this is a once off stay & it is nice to be made feel welcome no matter who you are. Our rooms were not ready upon arrival (which was fine as we were early by 1hr 50mins) - check in is 3pm. The lady on reception said she would “rush” the rooms & call me when ready. We went around the corner to the Bakery Cafe for lunch whilst waiting. However she never did call & I had to call myself at 2:55 to check. One of the rooms was ready & shortly thereafter the second one was. The rooms are very nice, everything clean & very comfortable. Bathroom very good, clean & spacious. The coffee maker is a Nespresso which is wonderful but there were not enough creamers. We called for more the next morning but still there were only 2 creamers in the pack. Also would suggest maybe extra bottled waters for guests would be nice. For the average person the mini bar prices are ridiculous so bring whatever you need for the nightcap time!! Overall though a wonderful stay in this landmark hotel & the Big Bus tour stops right outside which was very handy.My husband and I stayed just one night for a quick anniversary getaway. The rooftop pool and bar was gorgeous! Staff were attentive and kind. The location is perfect for anyone attending a concert at the Anthem. The entire place was amazing!"

Located in the wharf area in DC right on the water. Within walking distance to mall/museums. Arrival. Valet and Self. Valet includes in/out privileges. Self does not. Choose self to save money per day only if you will not need the car during the day. 35 vs 50. Self parking is located to the left of the hotel. Park in the purple area of the garage. The Front desk team was great. Got an upgrade. Who new a room needed a pool table. Excellent water view. Room was clean and spacious. Also has a mini-bar. If you plan on using have front desk electronically unlock it. My only ding was room service. No answer on Tuesday evening but Wednesday am they were on the ball. I think it was an anomoly. But they have a wonderful restaurant in the lobby ""Kith and Kin"". Check it out. Internet was good. Had a great stay. Will return. Great new choice.The Intercontinental is a gem! The hotel looks new and everything is very stylish. I received excellent service from the friendly staff. They even gave me, a very weary traveler, a free upgrade to the presidential suite (thank you!). It was by far the nicest room I’ve ever stayed in. I had a great view of monuments, boats, and the wharf area. The in-room dining was also fabulous, especially the brussel sprouts. I love this hotel!This is a fabulous hotel, as other reviewers have commented, this area is under construction and new facilities are ring added all the time, however that construction is no longer disruptive. I had a great Wednesday night stay here, the bar is particularly lively with sone great cocktails to sample. The surrounding area has a good number of restaurants and bars, so there’s plenty of choice for your evening. Retiring back to my room I had a very comfy bed and great powerful shower in the morning. If you like walking then this is easily walkable (20-30 mins) to the National Mall, Smithsonian and Holocaust museums. I will definitely stay again!We stayed at the Intercontinental in Washington DC to be near the Wharf. The hotel is spacious, modern and clean. The rooms were very comfortable. This hotel offers reasonable valet parking which is a real plus as parking is limited at the Wharf. We loved all the restaurants, bars and stores on the Wharf. Our favorite was Toastique which is a gourmet toast and juice bar on the Wharf. The toasts and smoothies are healthy and delicious. You must try Toastique."

From the valet, to concierge, room service, roof top pool staff, dining staff, it couldn’t be anything less than perfect! When we went to check out, we asked if we could keep our car in valet because we had reservations to kayak the Potomac River. Matthew, whom checked us out, not only let us keep our car in valet, he extended our check out to 4pm so we could come back and shower!

We really enjoyed our stay and the location was perfect. We were in town for a ballgame at Nationals Park. This hotel is close to the ballpark as well as all of the DC monuments. If the weather hadn’t been 95 degrees and extremely humid, we would have walked everywhere. The wharf has a bunch of great restaurants and some little shops. The hotel is new and very nice and the people working there could not have been any more friendly. The room was comfortable and furnished nicely. We had a view of another building, but I didn’t care because they let us check in several hours early and we just needed a place to rest. If you stay here definitely go up to the pool on the roof...the views are amazing. I highly recommend this hotel!"

Room size was a regular King.Pros:- beautiful waterfront location- brand new hotel, nicely furnished and modern- large 4 piece bathroom - nice workspace/desk in room- reliable Wi-Fi (ATT service is hit or miss in this area)- nice bar/restaurant downstairs, great cocktails- friendly staff- comfortable bed- great gym with 2 peloton bikes and tons of dumbbells all the way up to 80-90#, gym also has a fantastic view (included a photo)- really well priced, perfect for business- rooftop pool!Cons:- Unless you’re doing multiple activities in this area or traveling for work this is sort of out of the way in DC terms from the major attractions. They’re dumping a ton of money to revitalize the wharf and it shows, but you’re separated from the rest of DC by a highway so will probably want to Uber around.- my room was clean but there was some hair in my bathroom upon check-in.- staff is very sweet and well meaning, but it’s a new hotel and they’re all learning.Im happy to be staying here again, but probably wouldn’t recommend it for the first time tourist to DC as it’s a little out of the way. Great for a Nationals game or work, especially if you have business in the Navy Yard/Wharf area as I do. Definitely a beautiful space.My family had recommended staying down at The Wharf this trip and it didn’t disappoint! It was so good ended up staying an extra night! The rooms are some of the best I have stayed in!! Def check out the roof top pool for sunset!"

It’s pleasure stay here in summer time, nice roof top terrace with pool, clean and comfortable room. But woman in reception has tried to give us room worse and cheaper than we reserved. It was necessary to go to reception again and to ask to change room :(Basically, my initial experience with the hotel front desk was unpleasant when I called to let them know we would be arriving in the very early morning hours. When we did arrive we were greeted kindly (thank goodness). We are part of the Intercontinental Gold Ambassador so we received a welcoming letter, fruits, nuts and chocolates in our room. The room was welcoming and overlooked the wharf. We received turned down service. We would receive chocolates and water . . . but only for one person and we were three. I asked the front desk what was going on with this and they said the housekeeping staff didn't know how many guest were in the room. That just was such lame answer in my opinion. They should know because they replenish our towels and make the beds every morning. Moreover, the hotel should be communicating to their staff how many guests are in each room. My major disappointment was with housekeeping service. The room was never really cleaned. They only vacuum the carpets once a week per the front desk (or when you ask). The bathroom had ""someone's hair"" on the floor in a corner and after two days I asked if they could come and clean it up. The glasses we drank out of were never washed. We had to ask for the sheets to be cleaned. This part just turns me off. . . moreover, we were never greeted by the front desk staff when we walked in the hotel. The staff always looked disgruntled. The plus was the bellmen staff. They were always in great spirits. The location is wonderful. There is nightlife and lots of restaurants."

This is a brand new property I believe opened last Fall 2017. We stayed for a couple of days with two rooms, my husband and I and our young adult daughter and son. First the room and it's view was beautiful and peaceful. It was a long week and really wanted to enjoy the area and relax. The room was a normal size, but the comfort in sheets, pillows, and amenities was just right. Sometimes you just want to relax and no special fuss. If you haven't tried the bar or Kith and Kin, it is a must. We even got a chance to meet Chef Kwame Onwuachi bringing Afro-Caribbean cuisine with a flare. I understand there is a different menu daily and served family style. I was very impressed in the comfort foods amplified with elegant style. The Wharf is also fairly new. It had a lot of great restaurants and you can experience everything from seafood, Irish pub, to Filipino cuisine. I would certainly suggest you try Kaliwa. Extraordinary. The staff were super helpful when they need to be and leaves you alone when you want to just have some privacy. It's a hard balance, but they were very intuitive so I appreciate that. Sometimes, I just want to read my book and be left alone, but other times I want to be pampered and it seems they are trained well. The overall experience was incredible. The more and more I stay at an Intercontinental, the more I'm drawn in. I loyalty programs and usually work with just one, but really need to think about exploring more IHG hotel and resorts."

I was so excited to visit this property as a new Intercontinental in the Washington, DC area. This property is stunning. I have been traveling to the DC area for work for the past 10+ years, and have stayed at a number of different properties in the city. I love this property. Staff are wonderful, friendly, warm, welcoming. Excellent, from housekeeping to the valet to the bellmen, to the front desk. Rooms are spacious, clean, well appointed, very comfortable beds. I had an excellent night's sleep. I did book a room that overlooked the Harbor, and it was beautiful. It truly feels like you have escaped the city. This District is lovely. It's a bit of a challenge for taxi drivers to locate, so be prepared to provide some extra assistance in terms of where this property is located. The welcome gift provided in the room was really nice, an impressive way to greet their Ambassador members. One of my favorite areas of the hotel was the fitness center. They have the new Peloton bikes (which I love), along with free weights, machines, and a great selection of cardio. Spa wasn't yet completed, but appeared to be close to finished. Location is fantastic, directly on the main walkway, close to all retail, restaurants, CVS, the pier, and more. I highly recommend this hotel, and will be returning next month. This is my new favorite hotel in DC, and will be staying here for future visits."

Hotel is very new so no issues, our room had a river view which was great, staff were very friendly and helpful. The Wharf District is packed with restaurants and bars with free musical entertainment on some nights but plenty of places to sit out and relax at any time.I could not recommend highly enough to anyone intending to visit Washington for a city break.I decided to stay here while attending a medical convention in DC despite the hotel not being part of the hotels listed by the society. What a satisfying choice! PROS: New and modern hotel in the recently developed Wharf on the Potomac. The rooms are clean and furnished in a comfortable and practical manner. Adequate lighting (often a weakness in older hotels). Lovely large bathroom with great shower, shaving/makeup mirror. Large TV with huge selection of channels. Some rooms have nice views of the river and marina. Very helpful and friendly staff except for the bar. Antoine the doorman a prime example. Many excellent restaurants of all sorts and budgets. Most notable Del Mar for Spanish high end and Mi Vida for upscale Mexican (see my separate reviews). Great gym and lovely roof top bar. Best of all is the location. Super quiet area yet in close proximity to downtown, the Mall and museums (walking distance) and quick ride to DCA and the convention Center. Negatives: We changed rooms twice as the view of the other rooms was directly of a neighboring building. Bar at the rooftop bar needs to serve snacks and more wines (only 1 awful red) I’d definitely recommend staying here and plan to returnSo this hotel is better than a lot of the other Intercontinentals that I have stayed at. It was beautiful and located in the up and coming Wharf area. The staff are friendly and the rooms are luxurious. There is also an amazing area in the bathroom just for doing your make-up. That being said, there was construction happening while we were there and the pounding and hammering was so loud. One morning we woke up to find a person standing outside our window (and we were not dressed).... on the 5th floor. So yeah, that happened. But I’m thinking things will get better when they finish the property (this was back In February so they might already be done). I’d love to come back and see it when it’s truly ready to show the world. I almost talked to management about it but I didn’t want to be late for me flight."

Stayed at the Intercontinental for three nights and it was an awesome experience. The property was beautiful, clean and staff was over the top, especially the doormen. A- to A+ in everything important to me in a hotel room: spacious, extra comfy bed, plenty of outlets, big windows with a nice view, decent bathroom counter space, lit makeup mirror, big shower (not a tub shower) and good WiFi. Nice bar and lobby downstairs. Went to the Mexican place to the right, the Irish pub a couple places down to the left and also got fresh seafood on the wharf. I enjoyed the raw oysters and soft shell crab. CVS very close as well. Looks like you can charter a boat or just take a water taxi. I am coming back for another meeting in August and tempted to stay an extra day just to enjoy the area and relax.My husband and I often head to DC from Baltimore for a night or two get away. We chose the Intercontinental at the wharf, because we had not experienced this area yet. First off ,this hotel bills itself as a luxury hotel . There were so many little details that prevented this property from competing with other luxury hotels in the area.  Check in- we checked in at 4 pm on a Saturday. We had to wait and wait and wait. There was one person checking people in. Not acceptable. We were given a small bottle of water while waiting. When we did check in, we were given our key card and room number. That was it, no info on the hotel.... where is the gym, the pool, amenities available??? No info given.  When making this reservation I noted that Saturday ( check in day), was my husbands 59 Birthday, and we were there to celebrate. I am not asking for anything free, but when a property of this caliber, knows we have chosen to celebrate a birthday at their property, I think a “ happy birthday David I hope you have a great stay” should be noted ,acknowledged at check in. And as we have celebrated birthdays at The Ritz, The Four Seasons and most recently The Line hotel in DC, often there is a bottle of wine or chocolate waiting in the room. It is this kind of hospitality that makes me want to return to a hotel. The rooms are beautiful!! Be sure to request a water view, as I did not and our view was of another window. The bar-drinks were delicious, but once again, no staff hospitality.The bar was empty and the bar tender acted as if he was doing us favor to serve us.Just a little too much attitude! Room service- we ordered room service and the food was really good!! Also, the gentleman who delivered it was very kind and professional. There is a small rooftop pool. The view is beautiful. The pool was packed with small kids, not a problem as I have kids of my own, just an FYI. Also, it closes early. My husband and I wanted to go up and have a drink and watch the sunset- it was around 8pm and it was closed. A beautiful area with a bar and cool seating, why not have it open at night to enjoy the night view?? Would I stay here again, no. Too many other hotels with great hospitality in the area. We work hard and when we get away we like to relax and enjoy be pampered a little....This did not happen at this property. I think the staff needs more hospitality training. Cheers and happy travels!!"

I got the room on IHG points at a very reasonable (for the location/property) 35,000 points per night. This is really good value compared to other IHG hotels in other locations. It's been open since October 2017 and everything still feels, looks and smells new.Hats off to Ramsey at the front desk. We were tired after a connecting flight from the west coast. He got us a great room and the check-in process was very smooth. Ramsey seemed to always be working as he was there almost every time we went through the lobby. We were always greeted by him and all other staff and asked how our day was going and how they could be of service. The valets and bellmen, didn't get names, are fantastic as well.The room is no huge but a good size with a well appointed bathroom and a very small balcony. The TV is a nice size and the wifi signal is strong. Being a more modern property there were amply power and USB outlets throughout the room. Beds are very subjective but my wife and I agreed this was one of the most comfortable we've ever slept on. There isn't much storage space however and most of the drawers open by pulling the front down like an oven. Despite this the handles are in the middle of the door so if you're not ready for it the door hits your arm when you open it.The room is equipped with all the necessities and has a large closet near the entry. Lighting is ample and there is a master on/off switch beside the bed. Noise form outside is noticeable with the balcony door open but fairly quiet when closed. We did notice a fair amount of noise form the hallway either from other doors closing or people and housekeeping talking near our room. I expected the room to be a bit more sound proof.If there was a small knock against the property it was the housekeeping. The staff is friendly enough but things were forgotten and for the first two days they took our soap and shampoo when they were still at least half full. So much for conservation. Turndown was at random hours and on one day we were left a note that they skipped our room because of the do not disturb sign. That was at Noon. they didn't even service the room until after 1:30pm the previous day. Perhaps they're still working out the kinks due to how recently they opened.Overall though I would highly recommend this location. The Wharf District is a great location and it's a quick cab/Uber ride from Reagan airport."

As first time visitors to the WA DC area with no clue on where or what to see first, our Trip Advisor choice of hotel/location/airport transfer could not have been better. Highly recommend a room with balcony/waterfront view of the Washington channel, Potomac River, and Virginia coastline we stayed in room 829, “well worth the money” however would not recommend balcony rooms to families with small or active children.• The Wharf is less than two miles from the National Mall and Memorial Parks where most Smithsonian Museums’, Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument are located. There’s a free shuttle bus service operated by the city that’s located just around the Conner from the Wharf (by the CVS store) that comes by approximately every fifteen minutes that will take you to the National Mall or if you choose to take a taxi will cost approximately $10 each way. There are a number of eateries that’s collocated on the wharf within walking distance of the hotel.• Highly recommend purchasing a two day ticket for “The Big Bus Tours” that includes a night tour of the capital and surrounding monuments (great pictures). Tickets may be purchased at the Wharf hotel or at any one of the many big bus tour stops located throughout and/or around the national mall. It’s a double Decker open air (top only) bus where you plug in ear plugs provided by the bus tour and listen to a very informational block by block highlights of the DC area. They have three different routes that you may be taken, a) red route - around the national mall including the Capital and White House; b) blue route - Arlington National Cemetery/U.S. Marine Corp Monument; c) yellow route - Fords Theater/DC Zoo and city. The Big Bus Tours is “truly” a great value providing the visitor with information and/or DC sights that is not typically available to the average visitor with minimal knowledge of the area. • Carmel Car & Limousine Service Customer Service provided (through Trip Advisor) our “roundtrip” private car service from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport: Arlington, Virginia, 22202. Service was very professional (new black Cadillac Sedan with bottle water waiting for us in rear seating, driver dressed in a black suit. Very Impressive! The only hiccup to the service was a $10 airport fee (ea way) that was not included in the Trip Advisor total out the door price for our vacation. Would definitely recommend the above resources to family, friends and all those who are visiting the Washington DC area, I know we will upon our return to visit/tour the White House next year 2019 (White House tours must be made at least six months in advance of your visit through your Senators Office (visitors have to go through a background security check prior to visit). Capital tours may also be requested through your Senator or House of Representative however, your may visit the capital visitor’s center to get a tour of the capital on a first come first serve basis.

The room was airy and modern, with a knock-me-out, comfortable bed. Try to get a harbor view because it's magical at night. The staff are all friendly and courteous, and shared tips of restaurants and great views within walking-distance. We loved walking along the harbourfront and sitting in the courtyard in front of the hotel, where a tree that was the only living thing rescued by a 9-11 site by Battery Park in NYC has been re-planted and nursed along, Locals walk their dogs, and are on first name basis with doorman, giving the artfully landscaped area a wonderful neighborhood feel. The location is great, only 10 minutes away from all my meetings/sessions at the IMF, but so much more scenic, creative, and neighborhood-y than any hood I've stayed in DC before. It's a newly developed area, so there is construction, but I'm looking forward to seeing how the area develops.Definitely staying there again next time I'm in DC.Stayed with the family using points on a DC vacation. The best part of hotel was e excellent valet and door team. They were efficient and pleasant. The room was fine, bathroom was superb. They didn’t come to clean the room until after 4PM and we were back from the day's adventure. At that point we weren’t going to leave for them to clean. No pool yet. Dining was too fancy for a family. Much better options in walking distance. No bar I could find even for a drink to take to room. Nice views, the wharf area has some good spots and is growing. Too bad this hotel didn’t meet expectations.."

You are immediately greeted by the doormen and front desk. They allowed us early check in thankfully. Everything is sleek and new. The windows show the gorgeous views of the harbor. We were escorted to our room by the bell hop and he gave us clear directions and explained features of the room. The spacious room has high end fixtures and decor including granite bathrooms and counters on the long dresser/room furniture. The wide window has a gorgeous view. There’s a Nespresso coffee maker, make-up desk in the bathroom, wet bar, automatic light and thermostat controllers. Everything is modern, clean and the decor tasteful. We ordered room service and the person delivered it, poured the drinks into the glasses and gave great service. The breakfast menu was concise but tasty. We enjoyed every bite. The beds are very comfortable and it smells fresh in the room. I would recommend this hotel. It’s close to everything and worth the price.Beautiful hotel at the Wharf DC. A little confusing if visiting at night as per the construction and lack of signage makes getting to the hotel somewhat difficult. Canopy by Hilton and Hyatt House share the same block of space. Overall, IC The Wharf has the same standard of excellent customer service and hospitality like other hotels in the Intercontinental brand. The views are amazing and being centrally located to all the amazing venues and restaurants on the Wharf is a plus. Being a newer hotel there are a few kinks to work out. My balcony door failed to lock after the first night as I believe I was the first guest to open, simply pull the handle all the way up until you hear a click. Secondly, in the wonderful spa like shower, the moveable shower head push-in button disengaged from the wall many times after turning off the water. You have to hold it in place when turning off the water otherwise, expect a loud echoing stainless button crushing down on the shower tiles below. The other area for improvement would have to be WiFi. If you use more than two devices in your room expect the WiFi to constantly drop and reconnect. Internet speeds were low for an InterContinental brand, but not much of a problem as I was here for leisure, but for business the constant dropping would have been an issue.We booked this hotel because we were originally planning to see the cherry blossoms in bloom, and you get a nice view of the tidal basin from the river view rooms. Sadly, the blossoms weren’t in bloom yet. But we still had a great stay at this hotel. This is probably the nicest hotel I’ve stayed in. Check in was fast and easy. Valet parking was a breeze. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for our car to be retrieved. Room was big and very clean. The bathroom was very nice as well with a big shower and separate tub. Views from the room were nice too. We could see the Jefferson memorial, Washington monument and pentagon from our balcony. The surrounding area is great. Many bars and restaurants right in the immediate area. Check out was seamless. Every staff member we interacted with was very friendly and helpful. We can not recommend this hotel enough to anyone looking to stay in DC. We hope to get to go back soon. We stayed in room 918."

It was more a suite, actually, with a sweeping view of the river from the Jefferson Memorial to National Airport to Alexandria, in the far distance. The views, with all the activity (including Donald Trump, who soared by shortly after we arrived) were stupendous. The bed, too, reflected the general quality of this facility. You could sleep. And, right there (room, bed) is easily 80 percent of the battle. If you agree, read no further. Here's the catch: IHG. Like Accor and other large management groups, it's hard to fathom what's going on with the brands and how it all gets translated downwards. In this particular instance, the front-desk staff is simply not up to the brand's pretensions -- a fault not attributable to the employees, but the management. IHG makes a big push to have you join as an ""Ambassador"" and I bit. But has this program been adequately communicated to the people employed in this hotel? Nope. So they may wish to work on that. Also, this facility apparently employs motion detectors for controlling the air system in the rooms. Come this summer, it could be a challenge for them, assuming no adjustments are made. Many of the rooms, like ours, face the southwest, and interior temperatures rise fast once you're gone, even after you've shut the blinds. Washington summers area brutally humid and management may wish to not allow higher temperatures just because the occupants happen to not be there all the time. Even in March, it took an hour for the room to reach a comfortable temperature. But, save for that, this is a great hotel and IHG might have a profitable future here, depending ...."

We are IHG Ambassador Platinum members and chose this location for its amenities. The hotel is very new (opened October 2017) and as other reviewers have mentioned, has some kinks to work out. It does have a lot of potential, however. Here is the biggest piece of advice I can give you : the management team is there for a reason. Escalate to that level if you have any issues and do it early in your stay. One of the most exemplary employees I have met in a hotel was Manager Jonathan Hand. There is a reason he was chosen for that position. Again, as reviewers have pointed out, the front desk is hit or miss. Sometimes you'll have a very rude employee (Kadijah), sometimes you'll face a somewhat nice but uncaring/dismissive employee (Natalie). Do not let that influence your opinion of this hotel. Again, management will step in and fix issues. The front desk has alot to learn still. If you are an elite member (Ambassador Platinum/Spire) be aware that you might have to beg for your amenities (and not that they were really that great ), but something as simple as water or a welcome gift was overlooked until I called downstairs (and even then, it was as though nobody cared). We had to change rooms due to the balcony door not closing (it was a very cold/windy weekend)- and then we were upgraded to a higher level, standard suite (when we had to plead with Natalie that it is part of the benefit of our platinum status) . That night, the heating system wasn't working properly and after being placed on hold for over an hour and transferred around from operator to front desk back to operator.....my husband FINALLY asked to speak with the manager (again, please utilize management early on and don't wait like we did). The room issue was just one of many issues problems we were facing early on stay. Anyway, once manager Jonathan Hand stepped on, everything went smoothly thereafter. He saved what was left of my husband's 2 day weekend. The most important thing was that he showed compassion, was a complete professional, and did not make us feel like we were being a burden (unlike the inexperienced front desk). That's all any guest can ask for -- of course, he went above and beyond and treated us to many other things, but that's just an added bonus. Again, there is a reason he has been selected for that position. He far exceeded our expectations.. immediately upgraded us to a beautiful corner suite (Anchor suite-not yet open to the public- see the photos) . We were happy with that ..but it didn't stop there . We had thanked him and mentioned that we were having dinner at their restaurant downstairs with friends that night for my husband's birthday (Kith and Kin). He apparently remembered and had alerted the restaurant because during dinner, our server brought a bottle of champagne and said ""compliments of management due to some of the issues you have been facing."" Very classy touch. Again, these are the kinds of things that guests remember and appreciate. It definitely influences whether someone returns to an establishment or not.Had a fantastic stay at the Intercontinental this past weekend! The staff was attentive and friendly and the hotel itself is gorgeous. Staying in the Compass Suite was amazing- the views were out of this world and the room itself was perfect. The full-immersion bathtub and gorgeous balcony views (also the balcony is huge!) really made the room spectacular and totally worth the cost. Will definitely be back!"

I had booked two nights at the Canopy but then decided to try out the IC for a nightI was upgraded to a King Riverview room, which had a lovely view overlooking the wharf and river. There's a bit of plane noise though with the windows/door closed you can't hear anything but you can sit and watch the planes opposite at DCA if you wanted! After the snow on Saturday, Sunday was warm and sunny, and there was a lovely atmosphere around the hotel and with all the people sat outside the bars and restaurants.I was thanked several times for my Ambassador Spire loyalty. I was handed a small bottle or water at check in. No welcome gift arrived though, but I got 600 points on departure without asking. Everyone I encountered at the hotel was cheerful and welcoming. The bar area was packed with no spare stools at 23:45 when I returned, but the bar was closing, plenty of sofas and chairs around the reception area to lounge about in too.Lots of USB sockets in the room, no DND sign though, so housekeeping were knocking about 09:30.Compared to the Canopy or Hyatt, this hotel has the most River facing rooms whereas the others are mostly sideways on.Overall I was very happy and it was a shame I was only there one night. It's not that far from the National Mall, and there's a free shuttle bus running all day making it even easier to get about. The hotel is listed as one of the Wharfs Uber pick up points too making it easy to arrange a pick up.Having been a longtime Intercontinental patron, I continue to see a systemic decline in quality and service and no longer view it as a “high end” chain. I was hopeful that this new hotel would be true to the IC roots but unfortunately continue to be disappointed by the chain’s direction. My frustration with the IC Washington DC Wharf started at time of reservation, neither the website nor in-house reservations had information on whether the Water Suite was a true suite with a separate bedroom which was important to us as we were traveling with young children who go to bed early. After several frustrating phone calls – as it is incredibly difficult to reach the front desk or office on the line – I finally got an answer to the question and booked the room. Unfortunately our check-in experience was no better. I do not normally detail my experiences in such depth but as a new hotel I feel it is very important that the staff realize how making a small effort and tweaking the tone can make or break a stay and a customer base. We arrived shortly after 4 pm and were told that the room was undergoing final housekeeping inspection and would be ready in a few minutes. Not ideal, but not a big deal either and would not have been remarkable had it been true. We then waited in what was an empty lobby for 20 minutes when I then inquired again. This is the moment that the rest of our stay was tainted by the front desk and management’s inexperience and/or ineptitude. I point this out because a typical high-end hotel would have acknowledged the deficiency on their end and could have turned the situation around easily by a simple gesture but instead we were met by dismissiveness and rudeness (I have never been to a hotel before where the agents were not apologetic if the room was not ready after the check-in time, in fact I recall that in the good ole days the IC used to go as far as to voluntarily put me in a different room while I waited back when it was a premier hotel chain). Here, the front desk agent Ashley unapologetically stated that the room is not ready and it would be another 45 minutes to an hour. She then stated that it was because it was a room upgrade so we had to wait – as if it was our fault. I then had to explain to her that it was not a room upgrade but was what we reserved and paid in full for to which she responded by trying to downgrade our room by offering us a basic room that lists at nearly half the price and size without offering to change our rate – instead stating smugly “I know you will really like it.” At that point I asked for a manager who stalled in speaking to us for another 15 minutes. When he finally came over, he could not really be bothered with talking to us beyond stating we reserved the largest room available so he did not have any other options available and that it would be 5 more minutes. He did voluntarily offer one free drink which I declined as he said the room would be ready momentarily. I suggested breakfast for the children which he reluctantly acquiesced (to which I later found out he never made note of when I had to grovel for it the next day). Another 15 minutes later when no one approached us (we were still essentially the only ones in the lobby) I inquired again. After some more stalling by the front desk agent we were finally given the keys to the room over an hour after we had arrived and been told it would just be a few minutes. Although we were all tired and irked by the check-in experience, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room we reserved – as mentioned above we had trouble getting a detailed description online of what to expect. The Water Suite is a beautiful room and has a great layout. It is well adorned, has tremendous views and is very comfortable. Only downside for us was that the couch is not a sofabed and we were traveling with four people. As for the cleanliness of the room, there was room for improvement in that there was hair all over the tub and shower area, a coffee mug that looked used, dirt and debris on the floors, and stain on the comforter. With that said, it was otherwise clean and we understand the cleaning staff had been pressured to finish it for our arrival (however, it is hard to ignore that we waited for over an hour for the room to be “approved” by the housekeeping manager and it still had many deficiencies). I focused on our unpleasant check-in experience to make a point but unfortunately feel obliged to note that we had trouble whenever we asked the front desk for assistance including that even a simple request for a pillow that took over an hour. I believe and hope this has to do with the hotel being new but it really should be something that has been worked out by now. Similarly, a family member called the hotel to send cookies for my child’s birthday but also experienced issues in reaching someone who could assist. After several calls, he was told that the hotel does not have an “amenities menu” and could not send anything but wine to the rooms. Certainly, that cannot be the case as the hotel has room service and a restaurant – instead it appears to be yet another indication of this hotel front office’s failure to accommodate its clients. We were also unimpressed with the cleaning of the room which took place in less than 10 minutes and did not encompass vacuuming what had been a dirty carpet that was like that way when we arrived.I do want to point out that there were also many positive aspects of our stay. The entire door staff and concierge were very pleasant and helped change the tone. Even one of the doormen mentioned to us later that they he had seen us waiting in the lobby for so long and was really sorry for the inconvenience we experienced – a simple gesture that would have gone a long way had it come earlier from the front desk staff. We also found the Wharf to be a perfect area of town to stay. It is close enough to the Mall area to walk but also has ample restaurants and activities in its immediate vicinity.A couple of other minor issues we experienced that can more clearly be aligned with the hotel’s infancy. The room doors do not have doorbells and there are no do not disturb signs so when the staff comes by they end up knocking very loudly which can be disturbing if done at the wrong time. We also had trouble with the timing of the room being serviced that I have seen raised in other reviews. Within moments of finally getting to our room and before we unpacked or took our jackets off someone came by for turn down service. Then, the cleaning staff came very early the next morning to clean our room. Yet despite these visits, they each failed to pick up the sandwich on the floor that someone from the neighboring room had left in the hallway. A couple of other minor notes are that the suite could have used a second phone (again we were traveling with young children who went to bed early and every room service request took multiple hours and multiple phone calls) and more garbage pails.It is a beautiful hotel and a terrific neighborhood so I hope they work out all the kinks, I just wont be trying it again anytime soon."

William, at the front desk was very accommodating with helping me get situated in my room on the 9th floor. The views from the floor to ceiling windows in this hotel are to die for. I have never loved a hotel this much in my life. I can't wait to have an excuse to stay again! :) The only issue that I had was that one of my pillowcases wasn't that clean and the electric sockets on the back wall didn't work. I attribute this to being a newer hotel and still needing to get the kinks out. with a little more time, it will definitely have the polish that it needs. You will not go wrong at this hotel. It is in close proximity to many restaurants and nightlife. There is an ice skating rink at the end of the pier, as well as a fire pit. The whole place is just fabulous!

This was a staycation for me because this is my city. The hotel is beautifully designed with a modern decor featuring warm earth tones. I had a King Deluxe Riverview room that overlooked the marina and had a view of the Pentagon and the Air Force Memorial. My room was spacious, had floor to ceiling wrap around windows, and a modern and beautiful decor. It had a large closet with a sliding door that has a mirror on the exterior side of the door, nice artwork, smart control panel by the nightstand for the lights, superior bath linens, dark wood doors, great/comfortable bed with leather headboard with built-in overhead lighting, smart tv, luxurious robes and lighted security safe. The bathroom is large and has a bathtub and spacious shower with two shower heads; one fixed and one stationary. The smart design of the room includes the bathroom in that the shower control dial is on the opposite wall from the showerheads. The vanity mirror is large and illuminated and a small magnified/illuminated mirror . It’s obvious that great detail was given to every aspect of the hotel. The lobby is striking and welcoming and truly a gathering place. The Fitness Center is bright and airy and offers a view of the river. There are also plans to open a Spa and second restaurant (seasonal) on the rooftop. A pool will also open. Now for the staff, Gabriel checked me in and was welcoming. I also dealt with Ashley and Mike at the Front Desk who are wonderful and hospitable. The hotel’s main restaurant, Kith & Kin, is the concept of a celebrity chef who competed on the Top Chef TV show and in itself is beautiful and already a popular gathering spot. This new neighborhood is home to commercial and residential buildings, music/entertainment venues (large/small), bars, restaurants, hotels, various retail stores, a marina, green space, and a wonderful pier. There is lots of pedestrian traffic on the pier during nice weather so you can people-watch. The expansive pier includes stage areas for outdoor entertainment and a firepit and even water taxis to other nearby destinations like National Harbor in Maryland and Old Alexandria in Virginia. A vestige of the former neighborhood remains, the seafood market space where you can buy fresh seafood and even dine on fresh seafood in a casual/outdoor environment. As a native Washingtonian, I’m happy that my city now has two beautiful and different InterContinental hotels so I say welcome to the InterContinental Wharf hotel, a resort on the Potomac river, you have an excellent future ahead of you!!!"

The somewhat hidden ""amenity fee"" of $23/night is among the ""not so great."" This allows them to quote a lower price and then add a fee at check out making the lower price meaningless. Supposedly for having available a car service (if available) for nearby trips for a short period of time each morning, wifi and free phone service. But with mobile phones, who even uses the hotel landline anymore? Never used the car service. Wifi seemed fine, but most hotels provide it free anyway. The room was fine. Generous in the bedroom portion, tiny in the bathroom. A definite lack of enough electric outlets for charging your devises. Seems like an easy fix to add a couple of outlets to the desk rather than having to crawl around on the floor to find one. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The hotel itself is tired-looking with a need for more upgrading. There is virtually no lobby, but they do manage to have the daily wine tasting hour from 5 to 6.

Having stayed at several Kimptons, we've always found the accommodations to be top notch. What sets apart this hotel is the people. We had a few minor 'glitches' in our room and with the service. Definitely not expected but definitely not Kimpton. Upon contacting the manager, Ken, all was made right. Nobody is perfect but I always say you are measured how you recover! Thank you Kimpton Madera for leaving us completely satisfied, again! PS, we are food snobs and the firefly dinner will always be remembered and we WILL be back to visit. Thank you again, Kimptonpton and Ken. PPS.....Ken deserves a healthy raiseReally enjoyed my recent 3 night stay here. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Had a free upgrade and the Junior Suite I ended up in was excellent and I heard they are planning to upgrade the bathrooms soon staying ahead of the game on refurbishments.I will definitely be using this hotel again next time I’m in DC"

Kimpton hotels and am not THAT hard to please. What greeted me last night at this hotel was a bad joke. The lobby right off the bat is probably one of the smallest I've seen in D.C. (If more than one person checking in good luck getting by to the elevator). The gentleman behind the desk didn't smile once (after interacting 3 times). I did ask if I could switch to two queens instead of a king and was told they were sold out which of course I understood. When I discovered the state of my bathroom (more in that later) and asked to switch suddenly there was a perfect room with 2 queens (why I hadn't been offered that a mere hour ago is interesting) But the true reason I am giving this hotel my lowest rating yet of any I've stayed at is the state of the bathroom. First of all it is probably one of the poorest designed rooms I've ever seen. The toilet and shower are in its own ""room"" (more like closet). Be warned if you are taller than 6'3 you seriously will not be able to stand up in this area Also the entrance to this area is only about 2 1/2 feet wide so if you are bigger in size you may not be able to use the toilet? The toilet itself is impossibly low to the ground. The worst part is the toilet basically sits TOUCHING the shower. The shower in this room had chipped ceramic on the bottom with orange mildew stains everywhere , so gross. When housekeeping came after I alerted the front desk the guy said it was ""paint"" and I asked from what as nothing in the bathroom was orange nor had it been painted recently. When I attempted to order room service in the morning I was told I had the wrong menu and they no longer offered what was listed. No problem. I ordered tea. What came instead of hot water was BROWN water as they had not washed the coffee pot and simply put hot water in a carafe that was used for coffee. Disgusting. In addition the mattress was hard as a rock and valet parking was robbery at 48/ night. Do yourself a favor and stay at the George instead."

Everyone at the front desk is always pleasant, smiling, and going out of their way to make sure that you have everything/anything you need and more. When you travel a lot and are away from home for extended periods of time, these details really matter. Upon checking in, Patrick upgraded me to the tranquility room. This is the best room ever!! They had run out of rooms with king size beds (which I really wanted and had paid for), and he had no hesitation of spoiling me with the upgrade of having your own in-room massage chair. What an awesome treat it was! Thanks again so very much for my wonderful stay!"

Thank you for a lovely stay, will miss the States terribly and will definitely be back. We really don't have anything bad to say about Hotel Madera, our stay with you were great.We had a very pleasant stay at this Kimpton hotel in DC, as we can say, thankfully, at ALL of the other Kimpton Hotels we have stayed at (Old Town DC, NYC, and Boston). The hotel desk people were very helpful with recommendations for places to eat (""Grillfish"" was/is excellent!), and they were very responsive to the two minor issues we raised regarding our room.Our experience at Kimpton Hotels is that they pay attention to our concerns, and are down-to-earth people. They take the time to have a conversation with you, and don't make you feel rushed. They care, and it shows!"

Reviews of Hotel Madera were mixed but I thought I'd give it a go anyway. Booked an executive king through the Kimpton website and selected the $30 early checkin (noon instead of 3PM). When I got there, after 9 hours of driving, I was told there were no rooms available and that I could leave my bags and come back later. It was only when I showed my confirmation email that I was offered an expedited checkin, although the person at the front desk once again asked if I wanted to leave my bags and go get lunch. I opted to wait in the lobby and was able to get into my room at 12:30. Still earlier than 3PM, but I feel as though if I hadn't waited on site they would've taken much longer to get my room ready.I have nothing good or bad to say about the room. I book rooms at Kimpton hotels for the executives at my firm but I would not put them here.I got room service from Firefly for dinner - ricotta ravioli and shrimp and grits. The food was so salty it was nearly inedible, the shrimp had not been de-veined, and the grits were crunchy. I ate less than half of my food.When I went to check out, I asked if the early checkin charge was on my folio, and it was. The person checking me out stated that I was able to check in at noon so he wasn't able to waive the charge. I protested, since my room wasn't ready and I had to wait, and was able to have half of the fee refunded. However, I wish I had pressed harder for a full refund, as when the valet brought my car around, there was a scratch above the wheel well. It's not huge, and I spent a few minutes rubbing it to make sure it wasn't bird poop, but it's very noticeable. I drive a Mini Cooper so there isn't really any reason the valet should have had trouble parking my car.Overall, I wish that I had listened to the negative reviews. I will most likely not be staying at this property again and would not recommend it to my friends.It's been a few years since I've actually been back in DC and staying at a hotel having lived in Arlington for a couple of years. But, how I missed it. A really friendly hotel very near Du Pont circle and convenient for many other business areas of DC. They have a wine hour from 5-6pm every night - which I missed the last 3 nights and came in 15 mins late tonight -but the nice man in reception gave me a voucher to use at the bar.Friendly service from Justin at the bar which you feel like you can just plant yourself down and stay and chill.I had a great room with balcony and very comfy bed. I don't even care about not getting my Hilton points"

Just avoid it,"I have stayed at other Kimpton properties before with very good results: good places, hip, nice rooms and all the regular amenities you come to expect today from a decent hotel.Well, I was in for a disappointment, a huge one at our stay at the Hotel Madera. We happened to reserve a block of eight rooms for my daughter’s graduation way back since February, expecting the Kimpton service we had gotten before.I should have known we were in for a huge disappointment from the moment we walked in and asked for the pet-free rooms we were confirmed in writing to have: no such luck… The reservation’s coordinator lady by the name of Colleen didn’t bother to take note so it took the front desk person about an hour to sort out.To make this review brief, I will just point out some of the issues with the hotel:1. The safe box didn’t work. I had to report it and finally was fixed.2. The room keys had to be reprogramed every day, because the system kept changing the departure dates.3. The Wi Fi was very spotty and the network had to be restarted several times4. No coffee machine in the room!! Every Holiday Inn room has one guys… (I should be fair and mention that they do have free coffee in the lobby).5. My daughter’s room had no phone!! I was told their whole phone system is very old and they were having problems with it.6. On one of the days, my room hadn’t been cleaned by 4:00 in the afternoon although I had already mentioned it to the manager earlier.7. My room faced a parking lot with trash containers, which were picked up every morning at 6:30-7:00 (weekends) with the noise that is expected with this maneuver.If these are not enough reasons for you, please look at the photos below, no it is not a squirrel, it is a mouse right in front of the hotel. Whether this is a health hazard, I’ll leave it to the proper authorities to decide…When I went to complain several times to the manager on duty, the answer I got was: “you are right, there is nothing we can do, we are just cogs on the wheel”… very comforting words when you are paying $ 300.00+ a night per room.I should mention that one of the managers, Kelvin Rodriguez, was very kind and polite but also mentioned that there was nothing he could do…So if you are traveling to DC, I would definitely suggest you look elsewhere. ANY decent hotel will surely offer a better value, unless you are looking for a more authentic mouse experience Mickey Mouse in Disneyland didn’t cut it for you…"

The décor is contemporary. The beds are very comfortable. They have an abundance of outlets in the room for your data devices, etc. I was only a block or two away from a range of restaurants including The Palm. And the bath robes have a unique twist. I stayed at the Hotel Madera recently while in town on business and was very pleased with almost everything. I felt safe in the hotel, however, as a frequent traveler, safety is always a concern. My room did not have the extra safety latch on the door that would prevent someone with the wrong key from entering. I've had that happen a couple of times and always look for that. Also, if you plan to workout, you'll have to travel to the sister hotel about four blocks away.The staff was very friendly and professional. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel that offers a flavorful menu. Overall, it a great value property for business travelers."

After looking at several hotels, I decided on the Hotel Madera as I wanted a hotel more romantic than a regular Marriott or another change. The hotel Madera was listed as a boutique hotel in the Dupont Circle area. Some things you should know up front about the Dupont Circle area, love the area very quaint but parking is expensive or hard to find $45 a day at the hotel. However you can find on street parking (I did). Second, the hotel is pet friendly, but some rooms or floors do not have pets. I lucked out and evidently was on a non-pet floor.The hotel in a converted apartment building in my opinion. Lobby - The lobby is small, but who stays in the lobby any way. Wine is offered free from 5 pm to 6 pm. But it was not the best wine. The coffee in the morning was good. Elevator - Small like an apartment building, not large like a hotel. So just be aware if you have a lot of luggage.Room - Room is large and spacious and has some pleasant touches. It was the size of a studio apartment. However, the bathroom is small. The door needs to be trimmed so the bath mat will not get stuck under the door. Love the little sitting area. And loved the AC plug in on the desk which fits multiple devices was an excellent idea. And also love the bench at the end of the bed. Had multiple chairs (3) so you could entertain as well. Well stocked if not pricey frige, but no greater price than typically at an hotel. Pillows - Singled this out because they were too soft. The first night's sleep was horrible, due to the pillows. Second night was better for us as we put towels in the pillow cases to make them firmer. Restaurant (Fire Fly), there is a restaurant attached, we ate breakfast there. Loved the ambiance was wonderful. But the food was just average. The coffee was great. I say this because Marriott has terrible coffee. Area - The area is great if you like a nice urban setting, close to the embassies, and fairly close to the White House and monuments. If you don't mind walking you could walk, drive, taxi or subway. Stay Again? Yes definitely but Kimpton has several hotels in the area so I will try another one just for the experience of something new."

Kelvin helped me check in, took our bags, and valet parked our car quickly and with a smile. We were very fortunate that they were able to check us in to our room two hours early and then gave us a recommendation for an excellent cafe within walking distance. With two adults and four teenage boys, we booked the bunk bed room. There was plenty of space for the boys with the pull out sofa and set of bunk beds. They had their own TV and a table with games. After a long day out, we returned to the hotel late for the wine reception. Trey and the other employees went above and beyond and extended the reception for us with champagne, chocolates, and candy. Roomy, clean, and excellent service made this one of our best hotel stays. The elevator was fine and the small lobby didn't interfere at all in our stay."

So my star rating takes price into consideration. The Madera hotel is not worth that much. I would value the room at under $200. Indeed, after checking-in I found the Madera selling rooms for $129/night - which would be a great deal. I was in an 'executive' king. There were no USB chargers or outlets by the bed and no coffee maker. The TV was controlled by an old glitchy Loginet system and the Internet was slow (but free). I don't think this is a particularly good room for an executive, or any business person. Also, while the room is a nice size, the bathrooms are very small, and carpeted - which is simply not hygienic. Also the beds, linens and towels are not as nice as one expects in a $400 hotel room. They do allow dogs, so if you have a dog it could be a good hotel for you. However, if you don't like them, it would be bad because there are a lot. But the location is great, and the Madera would be a fine hotel for anyone with a $150-$200/night budget. Any more and you'll probably be disappointed."

There wasn't anything done wrong on their part; they just seemed a bit busy as they only had one person for the desk and one to serve as bellhop and doorman. The hotel finishes, for the most part, were quite nice. The room was very clean, but there were a couple of issues showing obvious wear. One of the window screens had a big part of the corner that was worn and pulled from the frame. Granted, 5th floor window repairs aren't easy, but it made the room look tacky - which it really wasn't. The bathroom area was decent, but pretty small. There wasn't space to store toiletries other than the top of the smallish sink counter. The sink itself was cracked and should be replaced. Again, it made the room look bad - which it didn't deserve. My wife and I differed over the comfort level of the bedding. Truthfully, we are spoiled by our own bed. The bed was on the firm side and really was without issue. We did have a slight issue with housekeeping. They neglected to refresh the soap and to replace the makeup removal sheets. We visit family a few times a year in the Foggy Bottom and DuPont area. Usually we stay in Modus hotels, but decided to try Kimpton in the area. I would stay at Hotel Madera again, but my wife wants to try some others in the DuPont area as well. On the plus side, the restaurant Firefly is pretty good for one attached to a hotel."

My only suggestion would be to check the television hookups. In the mornings, I wanted to listen to the news while getting ready for the day (and at night when I returned home) and the tv kept jumbling the picture and sometimes the sound. Also, they advertise ""free"" wi-fi, a wine reception every evening, and ""free"" coffee in the lobby from 6-9...but then they charge a daily fee for ""conveniences"".

What a delightful experience. We loved the location, loved the staff and loved our room. We had a queen double with balcony. It was super roomy(bathroom is small, but who spends much time there anyway) and loved the balcony. The only thing that would have made the balcony better was seating(but I'm assuming that's a liability nightmare). Beds were very comfy with lots of pillows. That staff just couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. It was fun meeting our fellow travelers during the wine ""hour"" or at coffee in the morning. They have bicycles available and dogs are welcome--I happen to like both. The Firefly restaurant was a very happening place in the evenings and was great for all meals. I hope to return to DC for more sightseeing and will most definitely stay here. I like being in a more lived-in area and it is right by Dupont Circle. The only reason I didn't give this a ""5"" is that because of different rates for different days, I ended up with three reservations; that led to one being temporarily lost and three separate bills upon check out. There's got to be an easier way. The television had reception problems half of the time as well--full disclosure, we didn't complain because, once again, we really weren't in the room all that much, other than at night. That being said, the staff, location and room more than made up for the three bills and lost reservation. The staff cannot be beat!!!!"

Saturday night was the worst night's sleep we've ever had at a hotel. We successfully changed rooms on Sunday, to find that we were in a smaller room, and the AC was still subpar (the entire hotel's chiller is being replaced. On Monday. After we leave). We were also warned that it could take up to 30 minutes for valet to retrieve our car, due to the National Gay Pride Parade. Saturday it took 50 minutes. Which made us late for the party we were scheduled to attend (the party was the SOLE reason for our visit to DC). Guess what sort of hospitality we received? Apologies and excuses. The AC chiller is bad. Sorry. There's a parade so it's taking longer with your car. Sorry. The night manager (Brittany?) was fantastic and comp'ed our valet parking ($50 per night) for our troubles. That would have been great, but when we called down for our car on Monday morning (to checkout of the hotel), we were told there was some ""damage"" to our vehicle. To top our weekend off, apparently the valet ran it it into a pole or wall in the parking garage. ALL. DOWN. THE. DRIVER'S. SIDE. The manager comp'ed our entire stay, and indicated that an insurance claim had already been called in, and that we would receive a claim number by the time we got home. Didn't happen. We still don't have a claim number. And really, if your business is hospitality and repeat customers, wouldn't you have done more to get us BACK to a Kimpton? Comp'ed our stay AND offered a free stay to show that KImpton's aren't' all so poorly run? Seemed the hotel manager didn't really care about customer service. We return to DC in 2 weeks, and will NOT stay at a Kimpton hotel again. This stay was literally a complete and utter fail. It was a waste of time in the city."

Then, after interacting with the staff, I realized that this location just wins on personal touch. The room was nice but nothing super special compared to other Kimpton standard rooms. Having a balcony was nice. Every interaction with the staff was super positive.Nick at the bar was great to chat with was clearly passionate about the guest experience. The hotel actually had a goldfish in the room ( almost all Kimpton properties have stopped doing this) and elements of the property feel like a B&B. If you want big and fancy, the Palomar is a few blocks away. The Madera has a small lobby and a personal connection to the staff.they don't have a gym, so you go to the Palomar if you want to use one."

We were upgraded to a twin bed room with balcony, by Dannyboy. Thank you for that. You've made a loyal customer. The room was very spacious, by any standard, and definitely by Washington stabdard. Good air conditioning. The elevators were quite efficient. There's almost no reception area, but that doesn't bother me. The staff was always welcoming. Didn't need any assistance, so can't say anything about their response. One matter of concern. There are no chain-locks to the doors. Only a double lock. We had the room locked from inside, but the housekeeping guy opened the door and almost walked in one day. Made us feel unsafe at nights, after that incidence. The location is supreme. Very near to restaurants, bars, ice cream shops. Lots of night activity. Metro station at a comfortable walking distance. Most taxi/Uber drivers know the place by name. So no issues there. This is the first hotel where I've seen this 6 socket rose. Very good."

We had a great stay in the room. Just like pictures it is nice and had a decent view. The bathroom a bit small and split but still nice. Loyalty program gets you $10 at mini bar. We saw a couple renting the bikes and wish we would have done this because the weather was beautiful. We also are at Firefly twice and loved it.This trip was a flying visit for us, as my boyfriend is a musician who was scheduled to perform at an event in Georgetown. This was our first time in Washington and I fell in love with the city on this trip. The hotel and the staff had a lot to do with this ""crush"". What a perfect vantage point in which we found ourselves. First, our room was really large for a city hotel..enough room for a kid to do a cartwheel. King sized bed, tasteful modern decor punctuated with bold colorful accents, very clean and perched on the 3rd floor, views of people enjoying the spring weather, birds chirping and tree tops all outside our balcony. The hotel is centrally located and within walking (wear comfy shoes) or easy biking distance to the Mall, museums etc. Super easy walk to Starbucks on Dupont Circle where other restaurants are abundant (24 hour CVS in case you were interested). Ayanna was the first person to greet us and handled luggage and musical equipment with great care. When she delivered our luggage, I told her my first instinct was to jump on the bed like a 9 year old. She smiled then showed me the awesome leopard print robe provided for your stay and said the hotel encourages embracing your inner child! The photo of yours truly is for her..and for you if you care..but back to the review, valet parking is priced in keeping with others hotels in the area. Wi-fi worked great. Tub and toilet are in tight quarters but I'd rather have the room space anyway. Large vanity/sink area. We didn't use the TV at all but it was big flat screen. The large room felt like a suite not just a room, with sofa, chair, coffee table and work station/desk. Well stocked in-room bar with the usual, plus various chocolate treats. Leave your yoga mat at home, they provide one and your Sun Salutations will be great on the balcony. If I had one thing to add, it would be to say that music from the outside of the hotel is audible from the room we stayed in...but mostly if/when the balcony doors are opened. The lower the floor the more you'll be aware of it along with ambient city sounds. That said, we loved the easy collage of sights and sounds just as they were and I slept like a champ both nights. Along with Ayanna...John, Brittney, Phillip and Anthony created an atmosphere of warmth and kindnesses you don't usually find time to experience. Grab a glass of the lemon or lime water from decanters in the lobby, chill out, stop and talk with them and you'll know what I mean. If you don't, you'll miss out on some genuinely good people who actually like what they do at this cherry little hotel. Many THANKS to all of them."

This is my first boutique hotel stay, but it's provided a step above other 4-star hotels. I arrived on a Sunday at 11:30 AM and was able to check into my clean and very modern room. Since the concert was canceled I enjoyed the peace and quiet; missed the complimentary wine tasting, but grabbed a bite the eat @ Firefly. I ordered the Bistro steak which was not so tender, although it was medium as I ordered (I would suggest something else from the menu). Service at Firefly was superb! Overall, the hotel is in close proximity to everything one would need in the District and a must for a repeat stay."

From the Valet to the Front Desk, we were made to feel like welcome guests. The lobby is indeed teeny tiny, but what great use they make of it! There's ice water, free wine hour complete with tasty little munchies and complimentary coffee & tea in the morning. It is a BOUTIQUE hotel. Small public areas, large public service! They actually seem to really get to know their guests. There are only around 80 rooms. Elevator is teeny, but it took us up to an awesome very large room, complete with sofa, desk, good-size bathroom, and even a separate small room with an elliptical, tv & fan in it!Amenities included an orange umbrella, animal print robes and a yoga mat! Bed was quite comfy. We enjoyed the attached bar/restaurant as well.Note: Parking is in the $50 a night range, but unfortunately not unusual for DC.Loved the location! Head one way and you're at Dupont Circle, head the other and it's downtown. Hotel is very close to both the Mansion on O and the super cool beer castle.TIP: Join the Kimpton Rewards Club before you go! We got free wi-fi and a $10 voucher card to use either at the attached bar or the room mini-bar."

The room had everything we needed including a very useful multi plug doodad, decent tv, nice balcony, huge dogbed and dog dishes. The hotel was a 15 minute walk to the White House. After we came back after our Christmas White House tour, we came back and had dinner at the Firefly. We didn't realize that we could have had a complementary glass of wine at the Firefly but will remember this for next time. Definitely a place to come back to in warmer weather. Very nice.I stayed here for one night for a business trip. I was looking for a dog-friendly hotel that was nice, reasonably priced, and convenient to public transportation. I certainly found it - Hotel Madera was lovely, and encompassed all of these qualities. The staff was friendly and helpful, and Firefly had a fun atmosphere and delicious food. I would definitely stay here again!One recommendation -- if you join Kimpton Rewards, which you will need to do in order to access the free wifi anyway -- they will likely send you an email with potential upgrades. I would recommend upgrading to add the breakfast and potentially valet parking, depending on your circumstances. We ended up having to pay a substantial amount for metered parking nearby."

She was attentive and very personable. The General Manager of the hotel also greeted me and gave me his card and said if there was anything I needed to reach out to him. This is a level of service I have come to expect at Kimpton as an Inner Circle member. I really loved their personal touch.My room was a upper floor room with a balcony. The room was nicely appointed. Its layout was more conventional than I expect from Kimpton Hotels, but there was nothing wrong with it and the room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. My Inner Circle amenity was very personal and chosen to reflect the local area, which I loved.The baths are tiny in Madera, but this doesn't matter to me very much as they are functional and clean.Overall, I really loved Madera.My husband and I wanted to 'get away' for a weekend, but not travel too far. We live in the suburbs of D.C. and planned to meet in the city on a Friday after work and stay overnight (Halloween night). I was looking for a nice hotel, reasonably priced, in the center of the city that offered something a little special. I thought that might be too much to ask, but I narrowed it down to a few hotels. A friend of mine highly recommended Kimpton and I am thankful that she did! I booked the tranquility suite and let them know the stay was a romantic weekend with my husband.The evening started with free happy hour wine at check-in. Then we went to our room, which was complete with champagne on ice, and some dark chocolates! We had a great view of the city and a massage chair! Next, we went to dinner at Firefly. We are both vegetarian, and had no trouble finding several items on the menu. The cocktails were also good, and after a walk around town, we came back to FIrefly for a nightcap. The staff were welcoming, friendly, and had a great sense of humor. We even bought the animal print bathrobe as a souvenir - and because it was so comfortable! We plan to come back for our next ""staycation."""

When he found out we were celebrating our anniversary, he gave us complimentary breakfast for our ENTIRE stay! He was generous in offering advice and really went above and beyond when we wanted to borrow their house bicycles for the day (unfortunately they only had one as the other was in repairs so Aron had to hunt one down, sadly unsuccessfully — but it worked out because it was easier to do our outing by foot anyway).Kimptons in general are very service oriented hotels, but this one even exceeded my expectations.

I enjoyed really my stay in Madera Hotel, I was there with group of people. We didnt have time to see all the places, but the hotel location was good for us and we could move around to discover DC. the area at night was safe too which was very good for mus.. many cafes and restaurants so we could had time to relax after work.I recommend you take a room in medium or low floor with street view.. it is not noisy at all and you will enjoy the view. The room actually was perfect for me.. you will not need any thing else.. and they put many options in the room..also cafe maker was always prepared and the hotel cleaning was very good too, which is something very important for me.What I really enjoyed is the breakfast at morning.. it is a la carte, but always many food varieties.. I always loved their cakes and fruits.. always very fresh and with the hotel location with many trees and tulips flowers around .. so it was perfect for me.Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful .. and even one of them told me about his story when he came to visit Egypt.I really recommend this hotel.. I surely will go again :)"

Location is perfect for exploring DC, short walk or bike ride to Georgetown, Embassy Row, great French food at nearby Bistro Du Coin (on Connecticut). The people working at Madera made this place special. Everyone we encountered was friendly, professional, helpful. The morning coffee (full bodied flavor) and tea as well as the after 5pm beer/wine/sangria was offerred enthusiastically. Happy hour in particular was fun for sharing trip adventures with fellow guests. We typically took our coffee up to our private patio (having pulled two chairs outside) and watched DC wake up. Our room was near the elevator and we couldn't even hear it. I paid attention one morning and was barely able to discern the sound.Bike riders can enjoy CapitolBikeShare, with a station nearby at Dupont Circle. Ask the desk to point you to a nearby bike shop for a free bike map, so you know where to drop off your bikes at any of a multitude of stations Five bucks a day for the bikes.Recommend this hotel highly! In fact, first one of these I've ever bothered to write."

For the most part, it was what I've come to expect from Kimpton: friendly staff, evening wine reception, late night cookies, etc. However, three things irritated me.First, I was a bit surprised to get out of the cab lugging two heavy bags only to find no one there to help. Not only that, but I had to maneuver the bags through two sets of manual double doors. For a Kimpton hotel, this was a surprising -- and bad -- first impression. After check-in, you then have to lug your bags up six or so steps to get to the elevator. Not a huge thing, but I'm a strong guy and I was hot, tired and exhausted, and found it an unwelcome annoyance, so I don't know how an elderly couple or someone with a disability (or just a really heavy bag) would get their bags into the hotel and to their room. The room itself was standard Kimpton (if Kimpton can be called ""standard""): upscale modern and very spacious -- except the bathroom which was ridiculously small (see photo). The flip side of that was that the sink was not in the bathroom, but rather was out in the hall, just off the bedroom area. The bathroom light is set on a motion-sensor, which in theory sounds good. In practice, it's an awful idea. When I have to get up at 4 in the morning to use the bathroom, the last thing I want is a sudden flash of really bright light blasting into my sleepy eyes. You then have to remember to manually turn off the light or it will stay on forever. Lastly, the A/C. Although set at 66 when I arrived, the room was not nearly that cold. I turned the A/C down to its minimum, but several hours later the room still wasn't that cold. On my way out for the evening i reported this to the front desk staff. On my return 5 hours later, however, I didn't notice any difference in the temp. It was in the high 90s outside - it felt hotter - and the room was tolerably cool, but I would have enjoyed a much colder room.The ipod dock was a nice touch. And In-Touch members get complimentary cocktails or snacks from the fridge ($10). NOTE there is no fitness room in the building, but if you ask they'll give you access to the gym at the Kimpton Palomar a few blocks away (I didn't have time to use it). I did get a good price, so overall it was a good value stay. They just need to step up their game to Kimpton level."

The location was in great walking distance to George Town and Dupont Circle, with great links to other tourist destinations. One of the tour buses drops off and picks up round the corner. Alternatively the tube is cheap and frequent.Our room was on the front with a balcony. There is traffic noise, but nothing more than what you'd expect in any city, it was acceptable. We could hear the lift, which was a little annoying, but not enough that we had to complain.The size of the room was great. Loads of room for both of us not to get under each others feet. The bathroom is small - but not an issue. The style of the room is modern and funky which we really liked. Didn't like that the duvet didn't have a proper cover and the sheet that was on top as like a make-shift cover kept coming off exposing the duvet. But the overall look and feel of the room out-weighed this.The only downside to this hotel was that when we arrived the receptionist spoke so fast and we were so tired (and being from another country the accept is hard to understand) they either didn't tell us about the free wine, cookies etc and I feel that we missed out. There was loads of liteture in the room, but nothing about enjoying a free glass of wine in the evening etc. It would of been nice if they had reminded us or left a reminder in the room. We didn't know all this existed until I started reading the reviews after.We also had trouble understanding how to get the free wireless. Managed in the end, but the person on reception wasn't the most helpful! She wasn't rude or anything - but just not helpful.Overall - this is a great hotel and would certainly recommend."

Wine tasting between 5-6, Oreo cookies and milk after 10pm and coffee in the AM. We were upgraded to the ""cardio"" room (elliptical machine in the room) which my fiancé did use. The linens and beds were extremely comfortable and the wet bar had plenty of snacks and drinks at moderate prices for a hotel wet bar (think movie theater prices). The room was plenty big as well as the bathroom. The cardio machine is in its own little room out of the way. We got two double beds but they seemed more like queen size to me. Plenty of pillows decorative and sleeping. The bathroom was nicely done in marble and had his & her bathrobes. Liquid soaps in the shower for easy handling and no mess. The staff was very accommodating and friendly as well. Only negatives would be the pricey parking rate of $36 + taxes so expect to pay $40 for parking per night. The parking is Valet only too. Not a bad but there is no parking garage. The bar in the attached restaurant had pricey drinks too. Expect to pay New York City prices and no coffee maker in our room but they do have free coffee in the morning in the lobby.The hotel is located about 2 blocks from DuPont Circle in downtown Washington DC. It is conveniently located to the metro at DuPont circle where you can get the Red line and only a couple of stops to Metro Center where you can get transfers to Blue or Orange. Red line also goes to Union station in about 10 minutes too, The DuPont circle area is a mix of all kinds of people, shops and dining. We felt fairly safe at night walking around but probably wouldn't want to be out past midnight by yourself (especially if you're a woman). We dined at a couple of restaurants in the area and both were nice, clean, and food was good. Prices were a bit steep for what you got and service was a little slow but otherwise not a bad experience. If you're staying for more than a day or two try asking the hotel about throwing in ""free"" parking. It’s worth a try to ask especially if you're going in off-peak season. I would have but we only stayed one night and I got a really good deal from Priceline to begin with. Overall our experience at the Hotel Madera was great and would love to to have stayed longer. I would highly recommend this hotel."

I love the rooms, the friendlyness of the staff, and the general quirkyness of the Kimpton brand, which sets this hotel apart. This time was special however, since I stayed during the 'great Blizzard of 2010'. The team of the hotel went out of their way to accommodate guests, and the manager immediately made sure that guests were given any help they required. Also, things like the free wine tasting/free coffee were extended, a free movie offered during the weekend in recognition that there might not be much else to do, and if it had not been for the snow, nobody would have noticed that Washington had ground to a halt outside. Me and my colleagues were very grateful for the attention and care taken of us. So a big thanks to the hotel staff, and I look forward to my next stay there."

Everyone was helpful through out our entire trip. One day we broke a pair of glasses and they helped us find an optomotrist very quickly (who happend to be only one street over). Every day when we returned to the hotel someone from the staff asked if we'd enjoyed our day. And I really believe they cared. Our only complaints are that the pillows are uncomfortable and the bathrooms are small. Other than those two things, we definately recommend this hotel. Be sure to ask for a balcony room!"

Here's my take on this boutique chain hotel.Cleanliness-Very clean. I saw no insects, cobwebs or dust on the furniture. The only thing I did notice, and only when I looked up close, was some writing on the wall in my hotel room. I could tell there had been efforts to clean it. They just couldn't get it all out.Service-VERY friendly folks at the front desk. They always said hello and goodbye to guests. One thing though: the day I checked in, I was offered a hand with my luggage, which I declined because I didn't need it. The morning I checked out, however, I had more bags and I wasn't offered a hand to get out of the door. I wasn't peeved, but it would have been nice. You say, ""Well, you should have asked."" I say, in the hospitality industry, a guest shouldn't have to ask for something as basic as holding the door open.Location-Dupont Circle is a busy residential/business area. There are plenty of sit-down restaurants there. But there weren't any fast food or takeout joints, which was inconvenient for me because I like to grab-and-go and eat in my hotel room. But there is a post office, a Fed Ex center, a Bank of America and a CVS all within walking distance. Plus, the Dupont Circle station is just two blocks away from the hotel. Value-I signed up for Kimpton Hotel's free membership program before booking. This allowed me to take advantage of their price-matching deal. I saw a deluxe king room for $181.50/night on Hotels.com. I called Kimpton and told them. So, instead of paying $216/night by booking with Kimpton, they knocked their price down to $181/night and I booked directly with the hotel, which is what I prefer. Rooms-I liked my room, which was on the top floor. It definitely had a wow factor to it. The bathroom was tiny, with just a toilet and bathtub in it. But the vanity and sink were in a separate area in front of the BIG closet. I also had a balcony, which I never used. Being a Kimpton member gave me free WiFi for my entire stay. It was pretty fast, and I never got booted off. It's an unsecure network though, so make sure all your firewalls and such are working. What else can I say? The hotel was very quiet and I only saw a handful of guests while I was there. Apparently, they also take pets. I never went to the Firefly restaurant, which always seemed busy during happy hour, or ordered room service because it was expensive and I was traveling on a budget. Also, the pillows on my bed had feathers. I don't think I've ever used feather pillows before. I mention this because I noticed during my stay that a couple of little scratches and a small rash appeared on my face while staying at the hotel. I don't quite know where they came from. All I know is I didn't have them before my stay at the Madera. My only guess is that I might have had a reaction to the pillows. If you've got sensitive skin, you may want to request foam pillows instead.All in all, it was a great place to stay, and I highly recommend it."

I also based it on the reviews on this site, which were mostly positive.I booked a king deluxe room on an upper floor with a view. My room was at the back of the hotel on the 8th floor. I believe some people did mention about the noise of the trash pick up, I will say this was a bit of a problem some mornings, and as far up as I was, it was pretty loud, but I didn't consider it something the hotel could really do anything about. The room itself was clean and contemporary, with cool furnishings, and my view was great, especially at night. I did order breakfast the first morning I was there, but at nearly $16 with tip for a continental style breakfast, I thought it was way overpriced, in fact, the entire roomservice menu was beyond overpriced I felt. There are so many dining options for less outside the hotel, I just decided to eat out. I did have a drink at the bar at Firefly, the restaurant located in the hotel. It's seems like a cool place and very popular with the locals. It's location almost can't be beat. There are so many restaurants near by I had a tough choice somedays on where I wanted to eat, and all within walking distance. If you're a sushi lover, stroll down to Sushi Taro or Raku, both are close by and both have awesome sushi! There's also a great Chinese restaurant nearby called Mei Wah which not only has great food, but has been popular with many political stars.The metro is near by, but I only used it once and that was coming back from my day. I simply didn't need it. Dupont Circle is a five minute walk away, a great place tro just sip coffee from the Starbucks close by and people watch for a while, especially on Sundays. The monuments are a bit farther if you're not much of a walker, it took me about 20 mins or so to walk to them, but I didn't mind the walk at all, and it didn't feel like it took that long. If you don't want to walk, the metro is five minutes away and a cab ride wouldn't take but 10 minutes.There is plenty of nightlife close by, both gay and straight, in which I did both since all my friends there are straight. Check out K Street Bar (straight) which is a short cab ride away, great place to dance and strong drinks! If you're looking for the gay scene, the gay area is just a 10 minute walk from this hotel, with plenty of bars and clubs to go to. Check out Jacks Restaurant and Bar, great outside patio to watch the boys stroll by and AWESOME crabcakes! They make mean drinks too :o)Besides the roomservice issue I had, everything was great. Very friendly and personable staff who were always willing to help out with any questions I had. They also had complementary internet which I had no problems with, and a business center downstairs with a printer to print out boarding passes if you need it. All in all I look forward to my next stay at the Hotel Madera."

Only a few blocks from the Metro. The hotel is ""pet friendly"" - we brought our small dog, and, indeed, they had an all-natural, gourmet dog biscuit waiting for him. This is an old apartment building that they renovated well. The rooms are hip and spacious (very well decorated), although the bathroom is small (the toilet and shower are in the same small room; the sink is outside and has more space). The street where the hotel is located, New Hampshire Ave., is relatively quiet, although you will get some street noise for rooms facing the street. (I wear ear plugs when sleeping in hotels, so no issue for me.) The service here was excellent. A free bottle of Evian, free Starbuck's to brew in your room, nice plush robes. Well stocked mini bar. Comfy bed. I could not here any noise from folks in the rooms next door, so good sound insulation. They are very environmentally conscious - even have a recycling bin in the room. We got a great AAA rate by booking with the hotel directly - $136 per night for a Saturday in December. Note that valet parking costs $28 per night (this is average for DC). We would recommend this hotel."

We have two adults and two kids (4 and 6) and booked a double beds room using the hotel's WEB site. We got a discount package from their website and the price was better than Expedia or other online stores.The hotel is located near the Metro station and we parked at the hotel's valet parking. Since the hotel is centrally located, we really don't need a car. But we drove to Georgetown, airport (IAD) and other locations that are farther away. We just walked or take the taxi to the attractions near the Mall. Walking to the White House from the hotel take around 30 mins - 45 mins with small kids.There are a lot of resturants within 10 blocks of the hotel. We had sushi, Cheesecake Factory and breakfast close by. Shops, banks, CVS drug store, book store and other stores are just around Dupont Circle.The hotel is clean. The room is very nice. Bathroom is a bit small but we did not camp out in the bathroom, so the size did not bother us. Internet connection is simple and fast. We have a room on the top floor with a balcony facing New Hampshire Ave. We liked the deco and we did not have any problem with anything at all.Since we are rushing to visit all the attractions in DC, we just grab simple breakfast on-the-go and did not try out the Firefly resturant. Also, the hotel offers an afternoon wine reception in the lobby hallway. Staffs were fast, helpful and friendly."

The location was excellent, the room was enormous and lovely, and we had a fantastic dinner at the Firefly restaurant.Our room was on the front side of the building, facing the street, with a full-length balcony. As another reviewer noted, these rooms are larger than those facing the other direction, but if you are sensitive to street noise you might prefer them. The decor is soothing and tasteful; Kimpton offers a variety of styles, so I advise you to look at their website to see which appeals to you, since they have several properties in the area. I was elated when I walked into this beautiful room.The bathroom is split into a spacious dressing area with a huge closet (with a velvet curtain rather than doors) opposite the vanity with tons of counter space, and a tiny room with the toilet and tub/shower (see photo). I agree with others who've noted this cramped space is one of the few negatives - it struck me as oddly out of keeping with the overall comfort of the room. But it was adequate, and I like having the sink & dressing area separate from the toilet and shower room.The lobby area is also quite tiny, but they do offer a happy hour with free wine. And there is a free ""business center"" (alcove) down the hall with a PC and printer, where you can access the Internet if you don't have a laptop with you.Our dinner at Firefly was exceptional, and the service was outstanding - in fact, we returned for drinks and dessert at the bar the next night because we enjoyed the place so much.I would absolutely stay here again, and recommend it highly.My partner and I visited Washington, DC for three nights one hot August weekend and we stayed at the Hotel Madera. We got excellent rates through their website. Their “Hot Dates, Great Rates” deal was for an amazing $129/night.LOCATIONThe first thing you need to know about the Hotel Madera is its perfect location. Two blocks from trendy Dupont Circle – where myriad restaurants and chic shops abound – but on quiet New Hampshire Avenue, the Hotel Madera gives you the best of both worlds. The hotel offers overnight parking at a hefty price ($24/night); so if you can, leave the car at home and take the DC’s magnificent Metro – which takes you almost everywhere you need to go – from Union Station or Washington National Airport. The nearest Metro station (Dupont Circle on the red line) is also conveniently located two blocks away.LOBBY/HALLWAYSAlthough a bit of a disappointment, the hotel’s lobby is perfectly fine. There’s really not much of a lobby to speak of, but they’ve clearly done as much as they can, given the dimensions of the space: put a desk, plop a banquette, use lots of dark, hip colors, and douse everything in soft lighting. If you arrive in the early evening, you’ll most likely be greeted by a few guests taking advantage of the complimentary wine hour (a nice and friendly touch). A couple of small elevators off the lobby will take you to your floor where lively carpeting and surprisingly harsh lighting await you. Each door is topped with a decorative molding that’s incongruous to the hotel’s modern décor, but it somehow works.ROOMYou open your door and discover where the Hotel Madera really shines. We’ve stayed in many boutique hotels where rooms are barely bigger than the beds, but our room at the Hotel Madera was comfortable, beautiful, and spacious. And very quiet, which is definitely a plus. The room’s décor was modern and hip without being too painfully so. Someone definitely paid attention to the details, down to the woven wallpaper. Our king-sized bed was comfortable. And the room came with Internet access, cable, and a nice CD-stereo system. The bathroom was small, as others have pointed out, but just fine. The multiple-setting massaging showerhead more than made up for that shortcoming. The one thing that kept our room from being absolutely perfect was the air conditioner. Maybe it was just too hot outside, but for some reason, while it was comfortable, the room was not getting cold. We had to keep turning down the thermostat to get to a nice temperature. This was a small flaw in an otherwise excellent room.SERVICEThe staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They strike a good balance between being professional and casual. There were a few hitches (one day, I had to wait a while for my car, but the next day, it was there in no time), but service is overall good. The staff may not always run like clockwork, but service is always delivered with a friendly smile, and that goes a long way in my book. An example: one early morning, while I was waiting for my car, an alarm went off at the front desk and the clerk turned it off and made a call to a room. That was a wake-up call! Yes, a clock at the front desk keeps all the wake-up call requests and they actually call the individual guests. I had to try it the next morning and sure enough, I got a call at the appointed hour with a human voice on the other line greeting me with a happy “Good morning,” instead of a computer coldly telling me this is my wake-up call.RESTAURANTThe hotel’s restaurant, Firefly, features a great room dominated by the large “Firefly” tree in the middle and a wall lined with birch tree trunks. While the food was not the best we had in Washington, it’s certainly good and the room is worth the visit. I had a chilled tomato soup that was perfect for a hot summer evening, and a juicy braised lamb shoulder that hit the right spot. Diners should check their low-carb diets at the door and try the truffled Parmesan fries; it’s the sophisticated salty childhood treat you never had. If you can’t come for dinner, at least come for drinks. The lounge area is the perfect place for a cosmo and quiet conversation. Service at the restaurant was similar to the hotel, slightly imperfect (I couldn’t hear half of what our server was saying), but professional and always warm and friendly.SUMMARYThe Hotel Madera is that small boutique hotel that’s perfect for the traveler who’s willing to forego the usual amenities (room service, fitness room, grand lobby) in exchange for warm and friendly service and beautiful, comfortable rooms in a perfect location. This was our first Kimpton hotel and I have a feeling it won’t be our last. Note to pet owners: the Madera is very pet friendly, down to the water bowl by the lobby."

Noticed there wasn’t a magnifying mirror. But other than that, the location and price make this hotel a great choice. So what happened? I found a cockroach in my room. I reported it to the front desk who was appropriately unhappy and apologetic. They offered to move my room which I declined. After all, cockroaches travel in hotels and are tough to get rid of. Anyway, after a long business day and dinner, I came back today to find a cheese and fruit plate in my room as an apology. Where it (the food) had been sitting for several hours. In a room with a bug problem. If they had put the food in the room fridge with the note on the table, that would have made sense. But I have to assume that the food might have attracted more bugs or been spoiled from hours sitting out. I had the food removed and their well intentioned gesture was wasted because people didn’t think. Oh well."

The staff are very friendly and professional with a lot of help and advice on our stay. The room was very nice and spacious with all the amenities you could need. We called into the rooftop bar for a few drinks before we went out to explore the area and again we had a nice time with the staff. I think the hotel is located in a great place for visiting the National Mall which is a 10 -15 minutes walk away. The L'enfant plaza metro station is about the same distance from the hotel and has the main lines around the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel for your visit to Washington dc for a nice visit.

The customer service was the best we have ever had at a hotel. It was resort quality!There was one particular young man that went out of his way to make my daughter happy. One night he blended up some berries for her when he found out she could not eat ice cream. The next day he found my wife and daughter and said he found gluten and dairy free ice cream! He did it just for her!! My wife and I were blown away at his kindness!!! I myself am a former District Manager over several locations and know how difficult it is to create this kind of culture.

Conveniently located within walking distance of National Mall near Air & Space Museum & Capital Building. Check-in and checkout was super quick. Must pay $40/day to park but that is to be expected in this area. Rooms are not oversized but complete with what you need and appeared like new. Bed was comfortable and shower head was good. Our room looked out to busy highway but was still very quiet. We actually liked the view especially at night. Outdoor pool was nice to have, too! What stood out to us was every single employee was friendly and conversational. It was noticeable how nice they were to us. We highly recommend for those looking for reasonably priced accommodations with no frills.We are both retired, and this was our first stay at this hotel, but it is on top of the hotels we have stayed at in North and South America over many years. The staff were ALL fabulous! Without exception, every staff member made us feel welcome . They continuously asked to assist and accommodate us. KUDO's to management and all staff. This hotel ""get's it"". We stayed one night for two baseball games and Smithstonian Museum we highly recommended this hotel. Food was great, room clean and hotel well maintained."

The hotel was clean, service was friendly throughout our stay. The location is only a few blocks from the mall, and we used Capitol bikeshare through the week which had a station just down the road, and there is a metro stop nearby as well. Be aware that food options on this side of town are somewhat limited especially for dinner. There is a restaurant in the hotel with some options. Breakfast was fine, Saturday they ran out of spoons, cups, and food, so they could improve there. The breakfast was fine overall and had enough options for us.There is a main road behind the hotel, but as we were on the 7th floor it was not really a noise issue for us. Some people commented on the lobby being on the 3rd floor but it was not a negative factor for us. They stored out luggage in the afternoon as our flight was later, which was a good service.Booked through Expedia, had no issues. There were 4 of us in the room, with a pull out couch it was reasonable. Room was typical size."

The hotel is only a couple of years old and is in a great location for exploring the city. It is about a 15 minute walk from the Mall and the Capitol building as well as the new development down at the Wharf. It is also a short walk to 2 metro stations. We pretty much walked everywhere and felt the area was very safe, even at night. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was very clean, bright, spacious and quite modern. You really can't beat it for the price. The staff were fantastic too, I honestly can't find a single thing to complain about. Yes, the valet parking is expensive but no more so than other hotel's valet parking in any other large city and you can find cheaper if you plan it. Ultimately you are paying for the convenience of having your car there as opposed to parking farther away for cheaper. Yes, breakfast can be busy but we always went early before the crowds and found there was always plenty of food options on offer. Please ignore any of the naysayers (I suspect they would be difficult to please in any circumstance) and book this place, you won't regret it! For us it came down to price and location when we were looking and we were very happy with our choice to stay here and would 100% recommend the Hyatt Place National Mall."

When I first checked in, my room key did not get magnetized correctly.  They re-magnetized the card and walked over to elevator with me to make sure it was working. They were extremely helpful. I had forgotten to pack toothpaste and I asked desk where I could purchase more. The woman at the front desk gave me free samples to use.  I asked them for a map since I intended to visit the normal touristy places.  They gave me transportation tip to use the circle line.Overall very friendly and helpful.  The doormen were just as helpful and guided me when I first arrived to go to the 3rd floor for checkin.  They always greeted me as I entered the building.The morning breakfast was decent tasting, nothing spectacular. They did have many warm items and sufficient choices (fruit, cereal, eggs, juices, bacon and one main daily item such as pancakes or biscuits and gravy.  The staff at breakfast was short staffed on the 1st day of my stay, but they still helped in getting some items that had not yet been set out such as butter, & and pepper, and napkins. They actually brought them to me after they had stocked the main area. The bussing staff in the morning was really on-top of keeping the tables clean so that visitors always had clean tables to sit at.On the 1st night of my stay I tried the restaurant during happy hour.  The service was good but the food was not that great.  The 3rd night of my stay I went to happy hour again.  The place was very busy.  I was sitting right at the bar and neither of the 2 bartenders ever even acknowledged me after 18 minutes.  I finally caught someone walking behind the bar and asked for a drink.  It turned out he was one of the front desk guys.  After about 30 minutes I finished my 1st drink and wanted another.Even though it had slowed down, the main bartender lady never even spoke to me agian, I had to track her down and ask for another drink.   While this was going on 4 different sets of people came and sat at some of the tables and had to wait several minutes before anyone came by.  One group actually came up to the bar, after having sat at their table for a while, and asked if they were supposed to order at the bar first.  While I was there, 5 different groups had to come up to the register to pay.  Even with customers coming to the register to pay, the staff still did not notice them for up to five minutes.  The couple next to me had to check on their own food after 20 minutes.  When they were ready to pay they also had to request thier check twice.  After my final drink, I cleared my own glass and waited 25 minutes for them to ask me if I wanted my check.  That never happend.  I finally tracked down the guy that was helping behind the bar and asked for my check.   I put my card in to pay and waited another 10 minutes.  The customer next to me was a regular and told the bartender about my check waiting, the bartender had no clue that it was there.  The same mass of dirty glasses that were there at the start, were still there right as I got my check.  I have only left $0 tip one other time in my life.  This was only the 2nd time I have ever had to do that.  All tolled, it took 2hrs and 30 minutes for me to order two drinks and pay my tab.What i liked1) Location near National mall, metro stations and bus lines2) Room was spacious and clean3) Internet was easy to access and signal strenght consistently strong on 7th floor.4) Front desk staff, doorman, breakfast staff were helpful.What could have been better.1) Happy hour staff was inconsistent to poor on level of service.If you are in the service industry, be attentive.  I think most people are understanding, and are aware if you are busy.  Acknowledge that you see them, and tell them you are busy but will attend to them as soon as you are able.  And then do just that, get back to help them when you can. That acknoledgment goes a long way.2) Be better about bussing and pre-bussing tables to minimize dirty dishes left all over during dinner/happy hour.I would still recommend this as a good place to stay. Do happy hour elsewhere."

The location as great-just a few blocks away from just about everything you'd want to go to D.C. for, the food can be either delivered via Uber Eats or you can get a limited selection of food from the lobby. All in all, it was a great stay. I would make a couple of minor suggestions though-trash bags in the rooms would be a great idea. In addition, moving the mirror from where it reflects into/from the bathroom would be helpful (especially when traveling with the family). One more thing, the sliding frosted bathroom door was difficult to open once shut from the inside. I was very disappointed that I could not get a state employee discount because I did not select that option during booking. It was not an option and the staff said they couldn't make changes. Boo :(The staff was pleasant, the room was clean (minus a scrunchy that was left under a table when we first entered the room). The menu, as stated, was very limited. I suggest either walking a couple blocks to McDonald's (which was slow to serve but hot food) or ordering through Uber Eats. Food around here is not cheap but still delicious!"

We stayed on the 12th floor, it was as quiet as staying out in the country even though we could see the highway below. We felt very safe on the quick 5 minute walk to the National Mall and Smithsonian Air & Space Museum.Housekeeping didn't provide a plastic liner for the ice bucket on our 2nd and 3rd days; I mentioned this to the front desk as soon as I discovered this issue on day 2, but it was not addressed until day 3. There was no plastic liner for the trash can in the bathroom; this can be a serious health issue due to the nature of items discarded in this can - used feminine hygiene products, disposable diapers, disposable wipes, used tissues, etc.The location is excellent - just blocks from the National Mall, Federal Center SW Metro station, and Pier 4 on the Potomac waterfront. It's about 15 minutes by taxi or shared-ride service from National Airport.Since this is such a convenient and popular location, the excellent, free breakfast room tends to become crowded as time goes on. To make guests aware for the most congested weekday and weekend hours, the front desk hands out a business-size card with the least-, slightly- and most-congested hours. the dining room staff is both pleasant and efficient.The fitness center topnotch, although I pointed out that the water cooler was empty on the day that it ran out, nothing was done 24 hours later.

The location is wonderful (only 10 minutes from DCA) and adjacent to national mall. It's within walking distance to most of the major attractions (Smithsonian, Washington monument, Lincoln memorial, capitol hill) although I would recommend doing the capital bikeshare in order to move around the city quicker and there is a bike rack right next to the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Marcus was very nice while checking us in and multiple people assisted us in getting to our room as well as navigating around the hotel. They have a rooftop bar that is open in the afternoons until midnight as well as a bar on the third floor with outdoor seating. The chips and dip as well as the flatbread Italiano were our favorite (save room for a peanut butter cookie) and the bartenders were absolutely phenomenal. Complimentary breakfast each morning had a variety of options and the staff was just as friendly in the morning as in the evening. Even though this hotel is located near the interstate and over a fire station it is very quiet. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious and the beds were comfortable. We were in room 916 with a view of the interstate and it was a beautiful view at night with the cars moving about the city. Definitely recommend this location for anyone visiting the city and wanting a location easily accessible to the main attractions but not in the middle of the city."

Another added benefit was the free breakfast every day which also saved a lot on this trip. And the breakfast is a large spread of eggs, sausages, potatoes, fruits, oatmeal, yogurt, pancakes, juices and coffees. There's always plenty of food, but less crowded for the early risers. The rooms are spacious and clean and new, just like the hotel. The staff was friendly and professional and made are stay a perfect one. I really appreciated the cleaning staff who adjusted to our varying schedule getting out the door each day. One side of the hotel is near a freeway, so if you are a light sleeper you might request a stay on the front side. This hotel is very family friendly. There is not an airport shuttle, but Reagan Airport is ten minutes away. I never saw more than one person in the workout room. The third level food and cafe offered beer, wine, coffees and meals 24/7."

The location is about 4 blocks south of the Air and Space museum. They do not offer an airport shuttle, but it is a short cab ride from Reagan. You enter on the ground level and the main floor is considered the 3rd level. There you will find the guest services desk, gym, complimentary laundry facility, business center, bar and breakfast and dining area. They offer a free breakfast that has a good variety to choose from. I was impressed with the adequate seating in the dining area. Even during busy times, there was ample seating options to choose from. They even had some outdoor seating as well. There was a rooftop bar area that had a great view of DC. We went to get a few photos during the night of the super moon! Since I am a Hyatt Platinum member, I was upgraded to a suite. The room was beautiful with a separate bedroom, a kitchen and separate living space. The bathrooms were quite spacious and even though the hotel is in close proximity to the airport, a highway and sits atop a fire station, we did not experience any noise during our visit. This has been one of our favorite Hyatt locations and we hope to be back in the future to stay again!"

Was a bit sceptical initially having read reviews re construction noise and safety around the Georgetown - I was pleased to note that the fears re noise and safety were completely unfounded .It located in the 22nd street and Georgetown is an up and coming area - full of activity and people . I would not have any qualms walking out of the hotel in the night (subject to common sense ) . My check in was very smooth and the staff at the front desk were very efficient and pleasing .I stayed in 723 located not surprisingly in the 7th floor was well furnished, clean and very comfortable . It had ample storage space in the form of cupboard and chest if drawers . There is a fridge(empty) which is ideal if you want to store your waters or drinks . The room had iron+ board, hair dryer and a 42 inch TV. Comfortable corner sofa suite and coffee table . The bed was king size and very comfortable ( went to sleep the moment I hit the pillow ). The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and towels that were changed every day during my 4 night stay . There is a coffee maker with tea and coffee sachets .Breakfast : was included in booking and the hotel provided a good spread . Cereals, variety of breads , yogurts, fresh fruits, juices and freshly cooked pancakes, French toasts, potatoes(delicious), scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, tea & coffee ! Timings are different in weekdays and weekends 6.30 & 7 respectively .It's a self service but the dining staff were very efficient and always had a smile in their face while clearing the tables .There is a dispenser in the lobby providing cold water/ juice -24X7 which I thought was a nice gesture .While going out the valet staff were very efficient in hailing cabs/taxis .The hotel has a 24X7 order and collect option ( modified room service ) - you have an option to choose from a abbreviated menu and when ready you come down to the Gallery host and collect the items to be taken back to the room . Worked alright for me although some may prefer the traditional room service .There is a decent bar next to the reception area .The hotel itself is situated on the 22nd street and once you are well versed with the local map travelling to major attractions is very easy . Your options include local buses, metro , taxi or walking ( perfectly safe ) .There is Starbucks just outside the hotel and a Walgreens store (although classified a pharmacy it's like a supermarket and stacks almost anything you need except alcohol ).Check out time is 12.00 ( midday ) but the hotel will store your luggage if you have a late flight to catch ( very convenient ).The staff at the reception are very friendly , polite and helpful .On the whole I really enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Place and would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to fellow travellers ."

Was completely impressed with the size of the room. Beds were comfortable and it was a nice quiet area. My only negatives: You have to go to the 3rd floor to check in and I only figured this out after walking back out of the building and asking a valet driver. Probably should have some kind of signage to make guests aware. The fridge in our room didn't cool any of our breveages even though it was set to the coolest temp. And our bathroom door didn't lock properly. Over all it was a nice place. We enjoyed our stay. Will probably stay there again our nice over night trip to D.C.

Everything is walking distance including a Metro station if you are headed in a different part of town.Breakfast was plentiful and was changing every day so if you are staying for several nights you wont be such eating same thing. They have nice seating area that spreads through the lobby and outside for a nice view. But it can get crowded by 8 am or so - they recommend to have breakfast earlier. I was there by 7 am and were able to have a seat outside. Staff was nice, especially Jonah at the front desk.

First, it's new and modern. Rooms are spacious and clean. Front office staff is very helpful and customer service friendly. Good free wifi. 3rd floor bar and food is above average. The breakfast is way above those of Hampton Inn/Residence Inn type quality - lots of choices and good quality. Only downside is when the hotel is full the breakfast area can be very chaotic - with long lines to get food. I travel for business - but if I were traveling with the family this would be a great location as you are a couple blocks from the mall. Only other big con is there is still not a ton of eating options outside the hotel around - but with the metro a couple blocks away you certainly have the access to get to entertainment districts fast."

The serpentine line wound out the cafe into the lobby. I passed, and even asked about transferring hotels--but nearby ones were full. However, room proved nice and help congenial. The real surprise was the Rooftop Cafe w a near wrap around porch/deck Even on this 100-degree day it is pleasant, and where I'm seated. I think I enjoy this even moreso than the W's view. It's not a hotel for a lobby experience (third floor) or the best location, though not bad, and definitely walkable to the museums. The new Bible museum is just around the corner a block or two, and will likely add significantly to the traffic here when it opens next year. And the Air and Space Museum is only 4 or 5 blocks north. The only downside about the room is the utilitarian shortfall of the bathroom design. Though attractive, the opaque glass doors make it impossible not to awaken your spouse or other party unless you either shower in the dark or use your iPhone light. Some great hotels have the same error, like the Palms resort in South Beach on the Boardwalk. The other nonfunctional design is the lack of shelf or ledge in showers for soaps or shampoos. Not sure how a co w long history of success ever signed off on such a thing. There's one tiny makeshift shelf a few inches high in the corner, but houses the rolled up floor mat -- standing on end. Overall, you can have a clean sufficient stay, but for the price not really a bargain. Must be a hot item on Priceline based on all the large families here."

Great facilities with a gym and pool. Also included is a buffet breakfast. Not much happening in the immediate vicinity of the hotel but it's within walking distance of restaurants etc on the north of the mall.This hotel was great in that it was brand new, had a great fitness center, breakfast was included and rooms were nice. Although there were quite a few things that weren't the best with this hotel such as the pool it was tiny. As we were there on very hot days it would have been nice to jump in the pool and cool down but it was packed, way too small for a large hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel late due to plane delays we were given a room with only 1 bed for 3 people. This meant that I had to sleep on the sofa bed for the night because there were no other rooms available. The breakfast was nice but the lines were long. Location not the best as there are no food places so just had to eat at the hotel which wasn't too bad. The rooftop bar seemed to be only open on Saturdays for some reason I thought that was strange. Also only having 2 washing machines in such a big hotel was not enough and there was always a very long wait to wash clothes. Having the lobby on level 3 was weird and a pain because the lifts took ages every time we needed to use them. In the end we have up on the lifts and used the stairs for most of our stay."

The fitness center is very open and not crowded all the time which is good. I didn't get to use the pool because I arrived late at night and had to leave early the next day. The breakfast buffet was great and similar to other Hyatt Place properties ie. bacon, french toast, yogurt, cereals etc. My favorite part of the hotel had to be the free washer and dryer. I came back to the US from dubai with a bunch of dirty clothes in my luggage and it felt great to have my clothes washed before heading home in RI."

So it's quite close to the mall and to many other attractions. It's relatively new and beautiful. But the best thing, besides the location, is the staff. I dealt with a number of them and each were very friendly and accommodating. One helped with a computer printer problem on the main floor. Another loaned me a spoon in the evening to eat the ice cream I purchased at a nearby drug store. Another gave me a small tooth paste because I forget it. Every single person was terrific.There is a full breakfast offered as part of your stay. This includes both hot and cold foods. Small pool. Roof-top bar with nice views of the city. Excellent free wi-fi. Some places charge extra. This does not. And the wi-fi works very well.Strongly recommended.We came across this Hyatt Place on the SW side of DC. Besides being in a quiet location, it was convenient to all the DC attractions and major restaurants. The hotel has a nice rooftop pool, breakfast buffet and 24/7 bar. The rooms were in great shape for a Hyatt place in DC and very roomy and modern. The only available parking is valet unless you Uber or ride the metro. The hotel manager and front staff were absolutely polite and made check in and check out painless and easy. Overall this Hyatt was a great weekend getaway at a moderate price. Highly recommend it as the staff are very helpful and will meet your every need."

We had no problems getting to the location, check in on the 3rd floor. The rooms were superb, very clean very spacious! We traveled with 2 adults and 3 teenagers! Believe me there was plenty of room and space in the the two queens! We were surprised to see that our room had a very nice sofa/sectional with a sleeper, not too mention it looked and felt very new! We were more than happy with the service we received! We dined at the lounge in the lobby, we enjoyed the sandwiches and little appetizers! No complaints here! The bartender a very hardworking and very kind gentleman that was working that night( I wish I had gotten his name) took great care of us and made us some really good drinks! We ordered quite a bit of food so it was only reasonable that it took a little bit longer for it but everyone working was so kind to make sure that we were taken care of and reassured us they they didn't forget! So all in all, because of the service and of course the price we paid for the two nights we stayed so worth the money! I forgot to mention that breakfast was just enough, traveling with hungry, picky teenagers, the complimentary breakfast was a hit! What teenager doesn't like cereal and toast and fresh fruits, and yes the fruits were definitely fresh! You bet we will return every year for the cherry blossom fest and love this location and hotel!"

The breakfast is good and is enough energy and variety to power you through the tens of miles you will walk everyday. Reception is very friendly and responsive, the concierge is very helpful and the breakfast crew, especially Carolyn, are a great way to start the day. The modern decor lends itself to the feeling of comfort and parallels the smart service offered by all employees we encountered. Some nights there is music in the lobby.

As I expected, so was this hotel.Pros:- Amazing (night) check in staff. I checked in late night around 10PM. All of the staff at the front desk was very helpful and greeted me immediately. Check in was short and sweet...exactly how I like it with 3 little kids. The man who actually checked me in on 3/28 was EXCEPTIONAL. I feel so bad that I cannot remember his name. He interacted with my kids and even made an Easter bunny out of a balloon for my oldest daughter. She was so excited! Thank you so much. - We had a great night sleep. No unusual noise. Mattress was comfortable. Our girls slept on the pull out sofa bed and they did not complain.- The room was modern and very clean. The bathrooms were adequately stocked. We didnt have an ""amazing"" view as there are mostly tall office buildings surrounding the hotel but that wasn't a requirement for us either.- Reasonable rate considering locationCons:- Upon checking in, we noticed the toilet would not flush. We reported the problem and was told someone would come and fix it. Nothing. In the morning, we called again and it took 2-3 hours for someone to come. With 3 little kids, you can imagine how many times that toilet was used and not flushed. My husband and I both had to take turns going downstairs to use the bathroom on the main level for visitors. I as not happy about this at all. Although someone did come, the issue was never really fixed as it happened again. Very disappointed.- Complimentary breakfast was horrible. The hotel was completely sold out due to the White House Easter Egg Roll and their were a lot of families with kids. Management did a very poor job with keeping the buffet equipped. With a sold out hotel to families with kids, the kitchen should have 100% been prepared. I counted a total of 8 times within a 1 hour period of food and drinks running out. This resulted in long lines of families waiting for fresh food to arrive. Not good at all! My kids were so hungry we ended up leaving to get food for them."

It is a very modern and up to date property. I arrived shortly after lunch and was able to get a room after a short wait in the restaurant/lounge (which is on the 3rd floor). For my two night stay, the room was comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and the work space and desk chair very usable for work in the room. I enjoyed the L-shaped couch for unwinding at night watching shows on my iPad.One of the main positives is the location of this facility to downtown government buildings. Some are actually close enough to walk to and it is fairly easily to hail a cab from this location (or the doorman will help you). While this appears to more a business hotel during the week, I was there during March spring break and a large school checked in obviously to tour DC as a spring break trip but they were pretty well behaved (well, I did have to get one of the kids to get off the hotel computers to print a boarding pass).I had a few minor complaints. I called for extra pillows when I got to the room and after being gone several hours, returned to find none had been delivered. No big deal – I called again and the person at the front desk said that they would send them up. Waited some before going to dinner and returned and still not extra pillows. I called again and told them that this was the third time that I had to call and was able to get them a few minutes later. It shouldn’t take three calls at an upper middle class hotel property to get something as easy as pillows delivered. The other item was the noise at night. It was not horrible but was somewhat elevated by city sounds. I turned the fan on the A/C to run all night to mask it so it wasn’t a big deal. They did offer ear plugs per a flyer in the room so I tried to take advantage of it the next day but was told they were out at that time. Again, a minor customer service issue that I wouldn’t expect at a Hyatt.They did have a restaurant and bar on site which is always nice. They offer the usual free breakfast buffet style food in the morning which is nice for some cereal, oatmeal, toast/bagel/muffin, yogurt, and a hot breakfast sandwich, etc. which is nice to get a quick bite to eat as there didn’t appear to be a lot of choices in the neighborhood that they property is located.Overall, it is pretty comfortable property with a good location that I would stay again for business."

Next time I am in DC, I will definitely stay here. It is a tremendous value for what you receive.Our family loved staying here 5 nights. Only 4 blocks from Air and Space Museum! Easy 6 minute walk to Federal Center SW Metro stop (turn right, walk past NASA headquarters (check out the gift shop!!!! 20% off sale for a few more days!), go past Pizza Authentica and Philly’s, turn left at the next block, walk under the railroad tracks, walk past PotBelly's sandwich shop and Starbucks and you’ll be at the Metro escalator. The rooms are very large for a standard hotel room! Plenty of room for a family of four with 2 queen sized beds and an L shaped couch, so 1 child can sleep on bed and other on couch. TV is great (large, clear flat screen), beds are so comfy (luxurious down comforter and feather type pillows). I loved the amazing amount of well-placed outlets: By the beds, two sets on dresser under TV, more by the couch. There’s even a USB plug on the side of the alarm/radio. Someone actually designed a room for people who need to charge multiple devices! The bathroom door is a glass sliding barn door style, so it doesn’t give as much privacy as regularly closing doors do. Also, if you have little kids and want to ensure that they don’t lock themselves in the bathroom, you can’t just throw a hand towel over the top to prevent the door from closing. Be careful with that.Free Wi-Fi for registered guests! Just sign in once a day.Seasonal pool looked very inviting but it’s covered now.Check in was quick. Check out had a hiccup, but the manager knew how to rectify it so we wouldn't be late for our flight. Right by the front desk are a selection of cold grab-and-go items like an Italian Wrap and a Ham and Swiss sub (about $10), spinach salad ($7), chicken Caesar salad and club type salad (About $10 each). There are Naked Juices, Red Bull, Gatorade, Tropicana OJ, Izze, and sodas. For the rest of the day, they have a nice choice of hot sandwiches, burgers, and salads that you can order from the kitchen at any time. Our delicious order came in about 10 minutes! These selections cost about $11-$12 and they were perfectly cooked and amply sized. http://hyatt.com/content/dam/PropertyWebsites/place/Media/Documents/all/Hyatt-Place-Gallery-Menu-Online.pdf?icamp=hbhf_menu_enBreakfast! Boutique breakfast! Not just scrambled eggs, but these lovely breakfast sandwiches with circle bacon and smoked cheese with egg on non-greasy biscuits! Also open-faced egg sandwich with melted cheese and bell peppers on a 1/2 of a biscuit! Then there's plain yogurt, red grapefruit sections, cut up fruit (pineapple, honey dew, cantaloupe, etc), and cottage cheese. There is also delicious waffle sections (including a powdered sugar shaker!) along with plain and powdered sugar cake donuts (medium size) as well as an croissant Danishes. Plain oatmeal with mix-ins of slivered almonds, raisins and granola changes to grits on some mornings. Both were delicious!They also have apples, oranges (navel type now), and bananas. A large selection of cereals including Fruit Loops, Special K, Cheerios and no name raisin bran, crispy rice, corn flakes, and frosted flakes. They have apple, orange and tomato juices, and both skim and 2% milk usually. Of course, there is the different breads and bagels with a toasting machine as well as single-sized peanut butter, cream cheese, butter, whipped spread and jellies.Coffee (Seattle’s Best, I think) as well as a large variety of the Tazo tea packets, too. (From memory: Earl Grey, Orange Sweet, green decaf, Chamomile, and Chai).My kids were happy with the breakfast selection and my husband and I enjoyed the variety, too. They have a very modern, upscale eating area with regular tables as well as bar height tables that the kids loved to sit at as well.There’s a beautiful roof level deck (P on the elevator) that would great to sit out and enjoy in warmer weather. They are evening growing a roof top garden cover, too! You can see the top of the Washington Monument and I think the Capitol. I think it would be great for fireworks.The hotel is right next to the freeway on one side. We brought a sound machine so the road noise did not bother us much. I’ve been to suburban hotels that have had more road noise, but if you are a super light sleeper, request a non-freeway facing room. For a downtown hotel, it’s surprisingly quiet.So, I’ve spent a lot of time on food, let’s work it off in the gym: a lovely large gym that looks out at the pool. This hotel boasts brand new Life Fitness treadmills (about 5), ellipticals (2) and recumbent bikes (2). These machines like the ones that allow you to do a “Course” through France! I’ve used these at another hotel and I still remember running through California, so I was excited to bike through France! They have a both an external USB plug as well as one you can use your USB cord, too. Oh, I forgot to mention that they have courtesy ear buds, too! They have 2 large stability balls and lots of room to use them as well as 1 padded mat.They look like they are going to get a nice selection of hand weights, but they haven’t come in yet. They do have 5 weighted medecine balls (I think 6 lbs and up). There is a large TV with its own speaker so you can stretch out or do abs on the floor and still watch TV, like at home. Why workout on vacay? Because you are doing your laundry in the room around the corner! For free!!!! They have 2 sets of washers and dryers that are the regular GE style front loading, including the option for steam! Someone had even left a bottle of Tide for other guests to use up, but there is a dispenser machine in there, too. The wash cycle for normal clothes is 1:05 and the dryer is about the same.The business center in the lobby has at least 4 computers that have a network printer attached. Great for printing off boarding passes! There are lots of other chairs for people to hang out and enjoy the beautiful space and the expansive windows, too.The neighborhood is great. It contains mostly businesses like NASA next door. We walked home from the Metro Federal Center SW several times after dark and saw no one that made us feel unsafe. They even have doormen on the bottom floor (parking attendants for Colonial Parking?)In summary, this is THE place to stay if you are a family looking for quick, easy access to the National Mall, or on business for a local company or the government. Because this is a nice small hotel, you just have to take the main elevator down to the first floor, and you are ready to walk to the Metro or to call up Uber for a lift. I’m sure I’m forgetting something but this hotel will be my first choice for accommodations for my family in Washington D.C."
