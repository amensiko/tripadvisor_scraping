Our final choice was based on our prior experience with the Hilton brand, the space needed, the price, and the many positive reviews. The location was of concern because of the distance from our planned attractions, but the access to the Red Line WMATA eliminated that. We did use Uber for a couple of outings, but the train worked out great with the loaded card. The hotel is in a nice area and attached to a mall. It is not your typical Embassy because if that. Everything was nice, clean and modern. You don't even have to go outside to access anything. The exterior side walks could use a few more bench areas for people watching. There is also a nice cigar bar / restaurant inside this complex. We accessed the hotel bar daily for the evening reception ( drinks ) and once for a night cap. The rooms were nice, spacious and cleaned daily. The only negatives I have are the frosted glass sliding door for the bathroom and the lack of an exhaust fan. The morning breakfast was great with the cooked to order eggs. The staff worked hard to keep this area clean and neat. Everyone in our group of 9 loved the place and would definitely stay here again. I would not stay here if you are wanting to be within walking distance of the DC Attractions. Plan on a 25 minute commute. We stayed at this embassy before moving on to NYC Hilton, both were fantastic, but we were definitely spoiled by our stay here."

We fell back into the hotel after a busy day being tourists and truly enjoyed the managers reception!! We were also excited to find out we didn’t have to leave our chairs and ordered dinner! There was a small hiccup with one out of six dinner orders, but the bar tender, Joel took care of us! We played in the pool before retreating to our beautiful suite. Thanks Embassy!! We will be back!! Oh, and one more thing, the Metro stop under the hotel was a great plus for all of our site seeing fun!!"

When I first arrived I was grateful that the front desk let us check in a couple of hours early. I have stayed at plenty of Embassy Suites before and the staff are very warm and welcoming. This staff at this hotel are very cold and do not say hello. The hotel is clean but the rooms are very dark. My bathroom door would not lock because the barn style door was not applied correctly. The reason why I rate this hotel poorly is because I woke up this morning to get breakfast and the line was outside of the restaurant, the staff serve the food (I have never seen this done before at any other Embassy Suites and I just stayed at one in Richmond), there were dirty plates and cups everywhere and there were not enough tables for the guests ( well there were enough tables but areas were roped off so we could not sit down. My family opted to go to McDonalds because there was no where to sit.This hotel is in a mall which could be a plus if you like to shop.I am extremely dissatisfied with my stay and will definitely stay somewhere else in DC next time. Poor job Embassy Suites Chevy Chase Pavillion!!!On Sunday... I decided to wake my family a little early to come and try breakfast out again and the line is longer then yesterday. I already have been on the line for breakfast for about 20 minutes and we are still waiting to be served. The hotel has employed 1 person to serve breakfast to sooooo many people. Trust me NEVER AGAIN!!"

NW, Washington DC, District of Columbia, 20015-2019, United States",38.9607639,-77.0848476,Nice clean room!,"Unfortunately, I was so sick from the mold that I was unable to attend the event I traveled to DC for. This was supposed to be a pleasurable trip and was single handedly ruined by the hotel. To recap, the water pressure is way to low but you would not know until you actually take a shower as it appears normal at a glance. You would be better off standing in the street during a rain shower. The sheets and pillow cases had black marks on them in both rooms we visited (306 and 325). The plumbing fixtures in both rooms were incomplete, something you would expect from a third world country. The cheapest thing in the room, a hair dryer, was in disgusting shape and delaminating on my hands. When I prompted the front desk for a new one, they sent the exact same one back to my room- a huge insult. The free happy hour is nice, if you want stale tap beer and rotten pineapple juice. Breakfast is super disgusting - eggs were like a thick soup. The main restaurant, Range, was ""permanently closed"" although you would not know it from the websites as it is still advertised today as an amenity and Embassy Suites should be completely ashamed for leading customers on. The biggest let down of the trip, was that I was unable to function during the stay because of the black mold in the air ducts. I was too sick to attend the scheduled event, too sick to enjoy myself and function normally and too sick to sleep as I could not breathe. After initially contacting customer service, I was awarded points for my troubles. After contemplating the offer I am slightly offended that my happiness, and more importantly - my health was endangered and the worth of my 3 unbearable nights at this hotel are worth 80,000 points. To say the least, this hotel is an embarrassment to the brand it represents."

A snowstorm was in progress as we arrived. I was glad the hotel has an attached underground garage to keep your car safe and dry. Then, you can get into the hotel without needing to go outside. Furthermore, you can access the red line of the DC metro (Friendship Heights station) without needing to go outside. Additionally, there are numerous restaurants and retail establishments that are reachable from the hotel without needing to go outside. This makes it a great location during the winter when there is a chance the weather outside will be bad, you can still get out and do stuff.As for the hotel itself, it has good amenities, including indoor pool with hot tub, above average fitness center, and a complimentary breakfast including omelets made to order. Rooms are available that sleep 6 and include microwave and small refrigerator, so a perfect room if you have a family of 5 or 6. The staff was friendly. It certainly is not the cheapest hotel in DC, but I think it is a good value for the amenities and fantastic location to the red line metro access, which is the subway line that gets you to many of the downtown attractions with a 15 minute train ride. Would likely stay here again on a future DC visit.Pro:1. Location, Location,Locationsurrounded by shopping centers and beautiful neighborhoods. I”m a runner and forgot my running shoes what a mistake. We drove our vehicle everywhere and had no trouble finding parking( luck maybe?). 2. Hotel was clean and Cozy3. Room Service was great, and it cost less to order than eating at cheesecake factory4.Wifi is fast5. Breakfast is great6. Managers social is a must, no top shelf liquor but its free during that time. The bar does have all the good stuff but it does not apply to the managers social.7. Staff is Awesome8. Ironing board was clean and so was the iron. I hate when hotels don”t care fore room accessories ( especially ironing boards and irons)CON:1. Room had a dead fly on window seal.2. Restroom was not as clean as it could have been ( hair on toilet ).3. No lock on restroom door.4. No vent fan in restroom.I would recommend to anyone and we will be staying here again.I stayed at this hotel for business in January of this year since it is close to our Microsoft office. This being a Microsoft preferred hotel, as well as newly renovated; I was expecting to have no issues. The rooms are very large and updated. Unfortunately, when I checked in my first room at 10pm, I had hair all over the toilet in the bathroom and on the floor. It was like it was partially cleaned. The front desk staff was extremely helpful when I told them what happened and got me moved to a new room. When I got to my second room, the room appeared to be fine until I looked at the bed. There were several long pieces of hair on the pillow cases as well as makeup. The bathtub was chipped and black mold was growing in the sink hole. There was dried food on the wall. I again called the desk and they came up with new pillows. The next morning and the following day I notified the front desk of issues with the room, but nothing ever happened. When I checked out, I let them know they needed to address the room and the standards for the hotel and maintenance. I hope this hotel can provide quick improvements and that this never occurs again."

Marriott ran out of government rates this week, so I was forced to try Embassy Suites. I don’t regret it one bit! In fact, I am now rethinking if I should switch my loyalty. D’Angelo at the front desk checked me in quickly, but he was gracious and answered all of my questions from where to eat to how far is whatever. He also remembered me when I walked in, and his warm welcomes made the entire stay worth it. Even though it’s a big hotel, it’s service and attention to detail like D’Angelo’s that keeps frequent travelers like me coming back. Location is unbeatable. The hotel is close to shops, restaurants, and the red line is underneath the hotel. If it’s cold or hot, you literally don’t need to leave the premise because everything is inside the pavilion. A CVS is on a different floor in case you need to pick up a snack or an item you forgot. The gym is unbelievable. It has the state of the art equipment and very clean. The free breakfast is awesome! The omelet guy is great! I enjoyed my stay, and I hope to return."

It is convenient to a ton of shopping and restaurants which you can reach on foot. There is Metro access underground to easily get you anywhere in DC, Maryland and Virginia. The rooms are very nice, very clean and have all of the amenities you could possibly need. There is a gym, pool, hot tub. It is reasonably priced for the area. The gentleman at the front desk (Collin) was nice, friendly, knowledgeable, extremely helpful and accommodating. I really like the atrium and everything being right there. I was on the 4th floor and my friends were on the 7th. There was a free breakfast which was very good and it offered all sorts of items from omelets to pastries. My fourth floor room had a view of Wisconsin Ave. I never heard anything outside with the exception of a siren or two. The elevators were good until one broke down while we were there which then created a problem and waiting. My room had a tub/shower combo, but my friends had a shower stall with a shower door in their bathroom. Other than that our King rooms were the same. I really like that the living space is separate from the bedroom so if you have several people staying in the room or if people come over then someone can have their privacy in the bedroom. The bed was comfy with lots of pillows. The bathroom has a barn door so no worries with a door getting in the way. Check out my pictures. I try to capture as much as possible so you know what to expect for a King Room. I plan on staying here on my next trip. It was a perfect fit for me and my friends."

It was close to the party, and there were probably 30 family members at the hotel for the weekend. Many in our group had young children, so the well-appointed, two-room suites were perfect accommodations. The rooms are modern and elegant, with all the amenities you need. Each morning, our group met for the fabulous breakfast buffet. Richard, who ran the restaurant, was especially helpful to our large group. The omelet guy was excellent. It was freezing in D.C., and it snowed like crazy, during the weekend, so being able to go to some good restaurants outside the hotel -- and shop at H&M and JCrew -- without going outside helped ease the chill. Overall, just a great stay."

The location is terrific - right on top of Friendship Heights Metro stop. The front desk staff are terrific (they even gave us free Metro passes), and gave us excellent advice about restaurants nearby including some in the same building. The two room suite was very good and quiet. Breakfast was well done.  Because of a change in plans, we ended up booking here just 2 weeks before arriving. All the best priced rooms were taken. So this was considerably more expensive than the Embassy Suites in DC where we stayed later in the visit. So...book as early as you can to get the best rates.Otherwise, everything was very good here.

Approximate size is 18' by 36'. Temperature in low to mid 80s. Adjacent locker room with good showers. What is the catch? Miss Ann's swim classes! I have been to this property three times in the last few months. The first time, I called the hotel the day before to check that the pool was open and they said it was. However, when I arrived, less than 24 hours later, the pool was closed for 24 hours ""for maintenance."" When pressed, I learned that someone had soiled the pool and it needed to be cleaned. The second time I visited, the pool was open and when I asked the from desk for the hours, I learned that it is open from 7:30am to 10 pm. What they did not tell me is that the pool is also used by neighborhood members and that there is an extremely popular baby swim class that occupies the pool for a couple of hours almost every day. When I arrived the next morning to swim there were about two dozen babies and toddlers with parents, teachers, and props (noodles, ducks etc.) in the pool. They were having a great time and it was very cute but not possible for anyone else to swim. They had roped off a lane for swimmers but it would have been impossible for anyone to keep the little ones out of it, let alone the plastic ducks. On my third visit, I timed my swim to avoid the swim class. It was a very pleasant pool. Reasonably clean, but certainly not sparkling and the awareness of the high density of babies and the recent ""soiling"" of the pool did not make it as inviting as it would have been. So, if you live in the neighborhood and are looking for a baby swim class, it looked like a fun time. But, if you are planning to stay at the hotel and want to use the pool, make sure you check with the management to be sure that the pool is open and do ask about the hours of the baby swim classes."

There are some flaws, like that they gave me tons of lotion bottles but no shampoo. Cleaning is ok. Decent staff at the desk and a decent bar in the lobby. Though the bar could be better. There was no view from my room, just a wall so it was very dark. And now to the best thing. There is a free reception every day for two hours in the late afternoon. You can drink as much as you want for free. This is absolutely great. They serve light stacks as well. You pay as much as for other hotels down town DC but you get much more for your money.

Rooms are very clean.The hotel is about a 30 minute or so drive to downtown and the attractions, but there is very convenient subway access. It might not be in the center of the city, but it's in a very pleasant upscale residential area, with plenty of shopping (such as Bloomingdales) within walking distance.

We booked this independently since our travel advisor ‘ trailfinders’ let us down in Chicago. This was the tail end of a long drive so we treated ourselves to a suite. We stayed in room 809. Arrival Vibe- easy access. Staff were very helpful. . We checked in without any problems. We noted it was a bit quirky, different, it certainly isn't a big arrival area. It was a spacious reception area and very modern and clean looking. The Room: it certainly was a suite. It was brilliant. It has a lounge. Big bathroom. Fridge, microwave, coffee, sink then the little kitchen lead to a very large bedroom area with lots of storage space. It was very clean and simply excellent, credit were credit is due ( considering the other places my wife and I have stayed on this road trip around NE USA). There was also two large TV’’s, 1 in the lounge and one in the bedroom. There was also a clock with an iPod docking station ( which fitted my old IPod 4) Breakfast: was included . It a good selection of everything. Fatty foods as well as healthy. Parking: is on site. It was about $30 a day I think. Location: it was about 6 miles from the centre of DC. My wife and I like to jog so this suited us great. If your not a jogger then you can take the escalator to the metro centre which is under the hotel ( friendship station). This is 7 stops from the centre at a cost of about $4-6 dollars each. We didn't look around the area of the hotel to much but it seem nice, we spent most of our time at the memorial grounds area. Generally speaking: It had an excellent gym and small pool. It was joined with a ‘ mall / shopping centre’ so there was a Starbucks and a few restaurants, offices etc it really did have a modern, intuitive vibe about it. Conclusion: I wouldn't definitely stay in the place again. If you have read any of my reviews then you will note I don't say that often but this place was awesome. They really got it right in my opinion. I would recommend for thus who like a but of joggerism ( jogging tourism) and those who are a but limited in mobility, if you can get a suite then I would recommend it's also. The vibe it gave me and my wife as soon as the keycard opened the door was one of absolute relaxation, If I had more time I would have spent a whole day with my feet up and reading a book in the lounge area. :)"

After a long day of sightseeing, it was nice to know if we didn't want to also search for a restaurant, we could simply go to the ones at the mall. They were Maggianos and Cheesecake Fact, which we have at home, so that made it nice in that we knew what we were getting, but also somewhat boring in that we knew what we were getting ;-)Also, it was nice to know we were right at a metro stop. Though it was a bit of a walk and down a lot of escalators to get there. The kids didn't complain though, because they were so excited about the below the ground metro/train since we had never ridden on one.Breakfast cooked to order included in your rate was also nice. Just like every embassy suites, and with a large family, it is nice to have. The AVERAGE: roomsRooms are averaged sized- definitely not large compared to others we have stayed at. We stayed in a standard King. They are, however, new and updated, which is nice.The BAD: pool was disgusting! Laundry facilities were broken. Noise level in rooms. Grumpy cooks.See pics of the pool. Our kids swam Sunday night, July 17, and the pool water was severely cloudy and dirty. It had a ton of oil film on it and foam. There were no towels when we arrived and the lights were turned off except for a few lights. Kids were everywhere jumping in and no one was attending the pool.I called down to front desk to ask to have them turned back on, so I could safely watch my younger ones swimming. They didn't come and turn on the lights for at least 20 min.! I called back down to the front desk and this time they wouldn't even pick up the phone even though I let it ring and ring forever. After several minutes of ringing, I gave up and hung up. They finally came up and turned on the lights and it was then I saw all the disgusting water. I got the kids out immediately.The man I spoke with in the laundry room said he saw the pool water on Sat and wouldn't swim in it.... So apparently they had this issue for quite some time yet failed to notice it or attend to it. Cloudy pool water is dangerous and I'm just hoping my kids don't get sick from it!Trying to do laundry was a nightmare. There were only 2 washers and 2 dryers for this enormous hotel! One dryer was broken and the other wouldn't dry your clothes unless u put them in for an additional time. While I was there, 5 hotel guests were vying for the laundry facilities for over 4 hrs! I ended up taking my wet clothes and hanging them up in the room overnight so as to start the drying process, hoping to finish it in the morning. Since we are a family of 7, we had a lot of dirty laundry and it was ridiculous not to be able to wash your clothes unless you were willing to take your turn at 4 hrs (11pm!)....!! No thanks.The noise in the rooms made it difficult to sleep. The living room portion of the rooms face the outside hallway which overlooks the mall, the dining area, etc. Unfortunately, the noise easily permeates the sofa bed sleeping area well into the night. It made it hard for my daughter to sleep. There were also several sirens going off on the street below which made for noisy sleep.Finally, the cooks behind the line served u with grumpiness each and every morning no matter who was serving. I was busy packing up our family in the room, and in the meantime my husband graciously ordered an omelette for me. The cook was very disgruntled about him ordering two omelettes, which is ridiculous since he should have realized he might be ordering for another person. Another day the cook was grumpy at me, not friendly at all. I know they have a very hard job, but I have seen other embassy suites cooks do it with kindness. Not here. The staff, however, who cleans up the tables after u are finished eating we found to be nice and friendly. The rest of the staff was neither overly friendly, nor unfriendly to us. So it just made for a lukewarm experience.... Have definitely had better!Overall, I don't think I would stay here again. I found the rooms to be too cramped and nothing here draws me back even though it was on the red line. I know we could find a hotel close as this one since we did have to walk for quite awhile to get to the metro anyway..."

The location is great, close to restaurants and the metro and it is right inside the shopping mall. Check in was very quick and finding my room was very easy. The room was typical of an Embassy Suites and was very comfortable. I felt like I was coming back to an apartment instead of a hotel room. The breakfast was good and typical of the brand. My entire experience from beginning to end was great and I really can't find a fault with my stay. I will definitely return if I need to be in the area."

THE BAD OF ITcheated on room rate- as the room rate rates changed ( checked rates every day for 8 months) it dropped twice. Canceled the higher rate and rebooked lower rates 2 x. They charged me $700 dollars too much. When it was brought to attention at check out I was assured it would be corrected. This was a lie. DO NOT leave desk without every charge correct. When called today was told too bad have to produce an email but didn't get one with prices, had to print it from a link which they were given. The kitchen/breakfast- The dishes were FILTHY, not one time but daily. The staff were surly and unfriendly and unwilling to do anything helpful. When told out of 2 % milk thier answer was drink the skim milk (Fidel). When I said I did not want skim milk was told sorry, drink the skim. The food was the same every single day, not appetizing or well tasting. housekeeping - hit or miss. Some days refill K-cups but no sugar or creamer, or the reverse, bedding thrown up, not made well. premium room amenities- The machine was empty often and then was broken all together last 2 days of my stay. THE GOOD front desk staff-super helpful , smiling and always willing to help especially Kyla. the metro- some confusion as to location when going through the reviews. There is a metro station as part of the hotel, get off elevator 2nd floor and escalator down 2 more. There is another one across the street. grocery store- out front door and across street (have to go in through the parking garage)complimentary happy hours - usually 2 beers and certain alcohols. You would expect watered down drinks but not the case, not limited to one drink, varied snacks and popcorn. The staff at willies bar were always upbeat and friendly"

NW, Washington DC, District of Columbia, 20015-2019, United States",38.9607639,-77.0848476,Overall great stay.. won't call it exceptional!!,"We visited DC over December for sight-seeing and based on the fact that the hotel was newly renovated and easily placed with access to sight-seeing we decided to go with the hotel. The overall location of the hotel is perfect, with easy inside access to the metro station with trains leading to all the important tourist sights was great. the 4 days we stayed here, not once had we to take our car.. the ease of metro was perfect. Carla (reception manager) was very courteous and helpful with the check-in process. Our server in the breakfast area (Richardson) was phenomenal with his service and help. Getting good service with good breakfast choices was a good start to our days. Overall room cleanliness is where I would say the ""renovated"" and ""service"" could take more focus and attention from the hotel staff. When we entered the room, we found candy wrappers in closets, under the bed and chairs - which was not pleasant, there was a tube cap on the bathroom floor and one of the wheels on the desk table was missing. For a hotel that just underwent renovation, you would expect such items to be taken care of and addressed. Had this negligence been of a single day we would have overlooked it but the 4 days we were there - the wrappers, bottlecap remained in the room with us.... Where it lacked for some basic expectations it surpassed on the others.. access to awesome mall with high-end shops, eating joints was fabulous. After a full day at sightseeing, we knew we had good choices to sit for dinner as a family before retiring to the room. the access to pool with it being open until 10:00 PM was a great welcome for our daughters."

NW, Washington DC, District of Columbia, 20015-2019, United States",38.9607639,-77.0848476,Great stay,"I had stayed here over the summer to take care of business, oh course I personify the tourist look with great joy so nobody would know. The staff were very helpful. We tried for an upgrade and were politely declined which was okay. We had booked two rooms for our party of 4, each were excellent and were on the fourth floor. We had run into a few issues, including the loss of internet, which last a few days. This was problematic when you are so dependent on your electronics and the only wifi one could reach was from the mall, that was a unfortunate experience but the helpful front desk attendant which checked us in (Charise? sorry its been a few months) gave us passes to watch a movie on the on-demand for free (we did get charged in the end for it but I think it worked itself out) and we got M&M's and popcorn for our troubles. The internet returned that night which was fine.The important notes for families and groups using the hotel. It is an Embassy Suites, been to one been to them all. The alcohol selection for the MR is good, snacks were chips and dips, a bit better than the usual selection at an Embassy. The bartender was sort of odd, he would stare at you and I would just smile. Maybe I am attractive, still working on that. The service was good. The Breakfast was fantastic, they serve you the food though which is becoming more frequent at the brand and the line can get longThe mall is nice, bunch of great shops and offers direct access to the MetroRail Red Line at Friendship Heights. There is a underground breezeway that connects the Mezza Gallery and the other entries to the trains.Hotel parking is underground and there is direct access to the lobby of the ES or the mall via elevators. The parking is TIGHT, clearance I think is 6'8"", don't trust me there but I know I have a Hummer and it would certainly not fit and the Traverse we were in was good but close by a few inches. The pool and fit room is on the top floor, the only reason I went up there was to use the lavatory which brings about a story. I left my Library of Congress reader card in the stall and I was called a few days later by (Charise?) and she said they found and would send it to me. Also when there was no internet I had a reservation at the Pentagon and needed to print some stuff, the front office did so for me no problem. Again quality. The hotel is quiet and there are two elevators for the several floors and we never had an issue and took the stairs often. The Pavilion is a nice touch and there are nice bathrooms, a CVS (no cigarettes btw, I don't smoke but someone was complaining about it), a Starbucks and a Cheesecake Factory (see review for Chevy Chase Cheesecake Factory). Great for families because of the Metro (no car needed) and only a few stops from the zoo! The room was excellent, I slept in the bed as well as the pull out sofa bed and both were excellent. The bathroom door is a sliding deal, so you can get walked in on if you are with families so take note and the view we had was of the Mezza Gallery and it was gorgeous and the curtains blocked out he signs from outside really well."

The breakfast is a full spread - filled with a variety of foods well beyond pastries and yogurt. I also appreciated the sodas, which were easily accessible. The happy hour for those who want a complimentary cocktail, was a nice touch. The best part was the location - inside a MALL! Located across the street from Friendships Heights station, the hotel is surrounded by restaurant options - as well as grocery stores (giant and whole foods) - as well as shopping galore. All of my co-workers raved about the hotel, which was a nice plus, especially the ""suite"" like room with a work area apart from the sleeping area. The staff was helpful and welcoming. Don't miss out on Collin's witty humor at the front desk (and cool accent). He just made my stay -- that much better. I'm certain to return again."

This hotel accomplished that very well. The suite was very roomy with a king bed and a separate area for with plrnty of desk space for her business. There were plenty of plugs with USB outlets in all rooms. The bed was comfortable and sheets and pillows clean. The bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel bar, Willie's Bar, serves as the location for the great breakfast which is included. The food is hot and plentiful. The bar has a great choice of wines and drinks/mixers during the complementary evening reception (5:30-7:30). Last call is at 10:00 pm. As a regular visitor of Embassy Suites on my business trips I expected nothing less than the best and this one was one of the best I've been to in years. It's located inside a very nice mall with great shops and restaurants in walking distance. Cheesecake Factory, CVS, Whole Foods, and a 10 Screen Movie Theater to name a few. DC sites were just South and plenty of shopping in the area. Metro transit is just an elevator ride down from the room. A very nice gym and inside pool is available along with a business center which allows printing and all the computer access that you need. If I had any gripe it would be the door to the room had a high gap on the bottom and you could hear everyone and everything going on in the mall or hallway. Very minor issue for me but again I wanted my wife to be able to focus on her business trip. No issues other than that. To the management and staff thanks for a great stay and we will be back anytime I'm in Bethesda (which will be often in my line of work). Thanks!"

It is a very convenient property (Red Line Access from basement), has maid $millions in improvements including an expanded lobby with large seating area and bar as well as upgraded guest rooms. All rooms have been remodeled. Nice parking set up with elevators to the underground parking right off the lobby. The service at the fri t desk was very good as was the housekeeper. The bad centers on the ""free"" breakfast and reception in the afternoon. In the past the food and service was quite good. This trip it was horrible. The breakfast buffet had been narrowed in items (only bacon and eggs and potatoes). Gone are grits and biscuits and gravy. The prescrambled eggs were a mix of slimy and hard egg mix. The bacon was flat tasting, the potatoes inedible and he bread products ALL tasted stale and were dried out. Chef making the oilers wasn't particularly pleasant and the omelet station was bland. The other bad was the exterior. There is no or very little bell service, due to the renovation the portico has been removed and it's hard to identify the entrance if you are not familiar with it. It looks like a mid rate hotel from the outside. This is an expensive property to stay at ($350 a night) and for that rate my expectations were not met. I was disappointed this year, where in years past I rated this hotel much higher. Not sure I will return without some improvements."

I had already checked in online before arriving at the front desk and the staff had my key and directions to my room ready to go. Super fast checkin! This was great after a long day of travel. The front desk staff quickly summarized their amenities & sent me off with a smile :-) We were there for a leisure trip to see the sights in DC. As others have mentioned, the hotel is connected to the Metro via an escalator to Tunnel. Ask the Front desk for the location when you checkin. I was initially worried that the hotel would be too far out on the Metro but it literally is just 5 stops to Metro center. We were advised not to rent a car and we are glad we did not and used the Metro every day to get around town.Breakfast service was available 7:30-10 each day which we fully utilized each day of our stay. The buffet had daily - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, Toast, bagels, (butter, cream cheese, and jams) yogurt, Fresh fruit, juices, coffee, & hot oatmeal every day we were there. Or you can get your 'go to the grill and have them make you a fresh omelet with a number of ingredients ( cheese, sausage, ham, spinach, mushrooms etc). The service staff are very courteous, and quickly clean up tables when guests leave. The breakfast service is popular, and although busy some mornings, we never felt rushed, and never had a problem finding a place to eat.Our Room was a King Suite which was fabulous. We had two rooms - The King Bed room had a Tall Bureau to hang coats, and had a safe in it. The bed was very comfortable, and there was an Ihome charging station with connectors for both Iphone 4s and 5/6s. This room had a Flat screen TV, and was nicely decorated. The second room had a kitchenette, with fridge and sink, and microwave. The bathroom was off the kitchenette, and there was a nice table, with 3 chairs, for eating in. The room also had a Sofa bed - which both myself and my son used on seperate nights and was surprisingly comfortable. This room also had a flat screen TV.Also the Hotel sits aside of a wonderful Mall, in which you can really get anything you may have forgotten to pack. There is a CVS, a World Market (which sells nice wines), several clothing stores - H&M, Old Navy J.Crew - to name a few. On the bottom floor there is a Starbucks.Across the street from the hotel, is a Neiman Marcus, a Bloomingdales, and several very nice restaurants. We went to both Clyde's (which we loved - try to sesame encrusted tuna!) & Chads (which has pitchers of craft beers for 12$) & had outdoor seating. Both restaurants nice. There is also a PF Chang's behind Bloomindale's (which we never got to). Also behind Bloomingdale's was a Whole Foods market, which we found very convenient. Some nights we brought home sushi or Pizza from Whole foods - which kept our food costs within our budget.Each floor has a snack machine, and upon checking you get a card with a code that enables you to get FREE snacks from the machines. We found this to be very nice, and often stopped for waters, and chips returning home from a long day site seeing.We were on the 8th Floor - Room 827 - and we did not have any problem with Noise whatsoever. I actually commented to my husband that I could not believe how quiet the room was. Our room was facing Bloomingdales plaza across the street. On one occasion we were awakened by a police car, but other than that the room was exceptionally quiet. There was no hall traffic noise, or adjoining room noise at all! Every Night they have Happy Hour - 5:30-7:30 with a selection of free beverages ( alcoholic and non) and a variety of snacks, that changed each evening.We had free Wi-fi being Hhonors members, and it worked quite well. Room temperature regulation was efficient, and very quiet. There was a card in the bathroom stating if you forgot your toothbrush or toothpaste ( and a few other items I am forgetting) that you could call the front desk and they would supply you items free of charge. I thought this was a very nice touch. The Housekeeping was exceptional, and we always had nicely made beds upon returning each day, and the shampoo, etc was restocked, as well as restocking the glasses we used in the kitchenette. Housekeeping was perfect! No complaintsOverall a fabulous trip, and we are already talking about planning a future trip with more family. Thanks for a wonderful Spring Break Embassy Suites! :-)"

I had to wait a while for my husband who was tied up in Washington traffic and they gave me a choice of being seated in the restaurant or waiting at the bar. The outside seating would have been my first choice, but it was threatening to rain. They checked back with me to see if I wanted to move or place an order for a drink. JP was our waiter in the upstairs restaurant and he was very attentive without being obtrusive. He always had a smile for us and knew the menu well. We had several special requests and he filled them all with Grace. For appetizers I had the crab cake with large lumps of back-fin meat - it had just the right mix of seasonings and binder. My husband had the scallop and crab embedded in pastry and onion soup. He loved it, the scallops and seafood were moist and cooked to perfection while the pastry was crisp and delicious. My entree was a scallop and rock fish dish in a butter cream sauce with corn chowder -- c'est magnifique. The desserts were just the right size and were phenomenal. We had the best service with superior dishes in a gorgeous setting just steps from the White House - who could ask for more."

Housekeeping and maintenance for our room were excellent. The service in Cafe du Parc was excellent-truly outstanding. And the food was quite yummy from the breakfast buffet and coffee drinks to the a la carte tofu scramble. Room service was excellent as well and arrived when promised and was nicely done and tasty.

The rooms are lovely and very well appointed - loved having a Nespresso machine in the room. The staff is efficient and accommodating and the restaurant for breakfast was wonderful (Croque Madame is the BEST!). The Round Robin Bar is NOT to be missed - Creative cocktails and excellent service and such a cool space. And being a huge fan of fresh flowers - the beautiful arrangement in the lobby was so impressive I had to take a picture of it. The Willard's location is perfect. Walking distance to many of the things you want to do in a weekend. We saw several wedding parties in the hotel which only added to the fun. A very special place. Can't wait to go back!This is a gorgeous venue that could not be better situated. The guest rooms are beautifully appointed and spacious. The toiletries are fantastic so no need to pack those extra products. The meeting rooms are full of natural light and the catering service was varied and high end. I would recommend this hotel for both personal and business travel as it not only lived up to its reputation but exceeded my expectations with its level of service.

On the plus side: It's in a wonderful location. You're not far from the Mall, White House and the restaurants in the Penn Quarter. The building is beautiful and the interior lobby is both luxurious and welcoming at the same time. Maintenance in this public space is attended to with great diligence by staff. Reception at check-in was pleasant and the personnel were obviously very skilled and able, handling a busy time with deftness and good humor. We had a Double Queen and the room was spacious with lovely views; windows also opened just a bit for some fresh air - always an asset. Bathroom toiletries were excellent and the towels were a good size and weight. Plenty of storage in closet and drawer space if you're here for more than a few nights. Very pleased to have the safe at eye level in the closet, so no stooping to get valuables in and out.Things that annoyed me: No reading lights by bed. This is something I've come to expect from 5 star accommodations and their lack was noticeable. If this is something that can be added to the list of hotel upgrades, I know it would be appreciated by many. Personally I found the bed too soft. If I had been staying for more than 2 nights I might have had to request a board. Minor housekeeping issues were also irksome; i.e. the minibar refrigerator was not cold, our creamer/sugar was not refilled and one of our rooms was not remade during the day while we were out touring.Also note for our room on the 8th floor, water pressure in shower is a bit soft and it takes a while for the heat to build up - so let the water run a bit before 'diving' in.All in all, a lovely stay and with a few adjustments/improvements it would be a 5 star review.The Willard InterContinental Hotel is an amazingly beautiful, impeccably kept walk back into history. It's difficult not to marvel at the details of the old world architecture in all of it's gorgeous detail. The hotel is steeped in history and it was fascinating to learn about the people who stayed there. We stayed in a suite that was fit for any world leader with a stunning view of the Washington Monument. The staff was also attentive and friendly. To top it off, the location is perfect."

The bathroom had a beautiful and comfortable marble tub. There were a few items that needed upgraded in my room, but all were purely cosmetic and did not take away from the overall beauty of the room. Room service was delicious and had ample options. My only real complaint was at check-in. I made it very clear my biggest request was a view and while there was a room with a view open I was strongly encouraged that I would be more comfortable in a larger room.

We were given a beautiful suite where there was wine, fruit, and a delicious and beautiful cake baked for us by Chef Jason. He researched popular desserts in 1962, and baked a Brown Butter Apple Bundt Cake. We were given a historical tour of the hotel by Brian, one of the concierges, which was very interesting. I wish I could remember everyone’s names because I can’t say enough about how gracious everyone was.

The rooms allocated were large, beautifully appointed with large comfortable beds. The corridors and reception areas are stunning and it was a treat to stay in such a grand environment.Service however did not match the gracious surroundings. We arrived in torrential rain and required valet parking. No one was at the entrance, there was no umbrellas and so we got drenched just getting out of the car. Entering the hotel wet, we then got very cold due to the air conditioning which rather marred the arrival experience. The agent checked me in quickly and I headed to the room to dry off.Once settled I returned to reception to discuss our stay and in particular breakfast. Initially as a family of four I had booked a two queen bed room however a few weeks earlier a deal had come up which allowed me a second room with breakfast and a very competitive rate. So I booked it.The agent could find no details for breakfast being included however my confirmation stated clearly that continental breakfast was included. When he saw this he referred things to a superior who in turn questioned the authenticity of the document, stated the hotel did not offer continental breakfast and told me to contact the agency( in Madrid @ 2am) to resolve matters. I declined to do so and said he should If there was doubt about the booking. There was a further issue relating to the breakfast for the second room also. It was, in short, an unpleasant and unsatisfactory experience.About an hour later he called me in the room to say that breakfast for one room for 2 nights was included but then proceeded to go into excruciating detail on how this would work. I lost interest after a while!At breakfast the next morning the a la cart menu clearly detailed “continental breakfast”As it turned out the breakfast was not much to write home about. The area was very small and cramped and the offering significantly poorer than a recent stay in another hotel at less than half the price. Serving staff were short on the ground.Having two rooms I noted that my room booked via the agency did not get a turn down service. The other room, booked direct did get this and so bizarrely, and despite both rooms being in my name, service was differentiated with my kids getting the chocolates!The hotels location was great for getting to the main tourist attractions and moving around D.C. on foot.In checking out the breakfast issue raised its ugly head again but the agent was very quick to deal with matters. He then offered the hotels car to take us to the Capitol and that was about the highlight of the stay.It’s a grand old hotel but service is not a strong point and at these prices and the ever outstretched hands got tips, it really needs to be much much better. I am a Spire level IHG member and whilst this counts for little in IC hotels ( indeed IHG generally) you would hope it would have some influence on how you are treated. I also have diamond status with Hilton and so since January just two nights this year at IHG hotels. On this experience I would be rushing back"

I got in around 10pm, but had no issues with check in. The lobby, famous for being the origin of the term ""lobbyist"", (as Grant would sit and smoke cigars there and people would come to him to try to gain influence there) was beautiful. The room was immaculate. Very clean, and well appointed. My only issues are that the pillows on Intercontinental beds are way overstuffed and not at all comfortable for me. Also, in the bathroom in the room I stayed there was no place to hang the towel anywhere near the shower. Not a major issue, but an odd misstep for a place that seems so attentive to comfort details, as it makes for an odd 8-10 foot walk to the door towel hook when you get out of the shower to try to dry off. The round robin bar was good after a long time on the road, the staff was great and made superb cocktails. Parking was a bit steep in the valet only garage. Also, I found it odd that when I tried to break a 10 at the registration desk, I was told that they had no change to do that yet (at 12pm, the regular check out time) and was sent to try the bellhop desk. Seems like minor monetary transactions like this (to be used for tips) would be expected at check-in/outs, but they were not prepared. Again a totally minor thing, just found it odd and a bit of a misstep. The hotel is beautiful, and overall it was a very good experience staying there. I highly recommend it."

The hotel is richly decorated and full of history. The service at the front desk was outstanding. Our room was on the 10th floor and was quiet the entire stay. The room was clean and very large compared to many other rooms we've stayed at in other large cities. The bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept very well. The location near the White House just north of the National Mall was perfect for sightseeing. We were able to run back to the hotel whenever we wanted to refresh and cool off from the heat. They do need to work on getting more vegan options on the room service menu since my wife is vegan. We look forward to returning in the near future!

Staff was friendly and accommodating.We booked into The Willard about 4 months in advance for 2 reasons: 2 Chase IHG card free anniversary nights that expire in June and to enjoy Afternoon Tea in Peacock Alley. We were favorably impressed from the moment we arrived, first by the gentleman that greeted our cab and took our bags when we arrived and then by Ali, in Guest Relations, who handled our reservations, straightened out a problem for us and reviewed a map of attractions....he was terrific! The hotel is in a prime location on Pennsylvania Ave across the street from Pershing Park and within a block or so of the White House and the Washington Monument. Many attractions are within walking distance and taxis are readily available.The iconic hotel has been refurbished and is generally in very good condition. Our room was in excellent shape with service to match. The historic Round Robin bar is located just off the Lobby. It is worth a visit whether or not you’re staying at the hotel.Peacock Alley is the name of the corridor that runs from the Front Lobby to the rear entrance. It is richly appointed and the site where Afternoon Tea is served. A harpist is added during Tea and the atmosphere is quite something. That being said, we were somewhat disappointed in our Tea experience as the finger sandwiches were not up to par and the atmosphere near our table was completely ruined for a period of time by a throng of loud wedding attendees who were marshaled into a space adjacent to our table."

Arrived on a Friday evening. Valet parked my car and check in was friendly and efficient. My room was on the 11th floor with a great view of The Washington Monument and National Mall. I paid extra for the view and it was worth it. The window, however, isn’t large and it’s paneled, so don’t expect a floor to ceiling panoramic view. The room itself was very nice and clean. Two robes and slippers can be found in the closet. I was near the elevator and didn’t hear any hallway noise during my stay. The location is excellent. It’s right across the street from The White House and within walking distance to many of the museums and other attractions. I do recommend the breakfast buffet at Café du Parc, which includes a made to order omelet delivered to your table if that’s what you want. Service was quick and the buffet items were very good. As others have said, this hotel has a rich history and there is even a collection of historical items on the property. There is also a convenience store/gift shop in the hotel."

It is a D.C. Classic and is especially beautiful at Christmas! If you can't stay there than at least visit for brunch one day. It's traditional beauty combined with its location next to the White House makes it second to none. I can't wait to go back.During our visit to major attractions in Washington, DC, we had stayed at Willard InterContinental Washington Hotel from December 4 to 6, 2017. Upon arrival at Union Station by Amtrak train, we took a taxi for a short ride to the hotel. The hotel was elegant and very conveniently located for our visits to the major attractions such as war memorials, Museum of the Bible, and National Art Gallery. The hotel was also close to ""Metro Center"" metro stop which was 2 stops from Union Station.The hotel was a large classy building with its main entrance at 1401 Pennsylvania Avenue NW and its rear entrance at 1401 F Street, NW. The hotel's lobby area was elegant, and Peacock Alley was beautiful. Our room was spacious and well appointed with modern amenities. Our room was on 5th floor, facing F Street, NW, and the room was sound proofed from street noise. The hotel has restaurants which were somewhat expensive. So, we had meals at nearby restaurants such as ""The Hamilton"", ""Corner Bakery Coffeeshop"" and ""Eat at National Place"" (a very good food court).Since we arrived at the hotel in the afternoon on December 3rd, we just visited Museum of the Bible by using Uber car service, and spent the afternoon at the remarkable museum. Uber cars were readily available and cheaper than taxis in Washington, DC. [One caution about using Uber service from the hotel: When you monitor your oncoming Uber car, check the Uber's destination address. If the address shows ""1401 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW"", you should wait for the Uber car at the hotel's front entrance. But if the address shows ""1401 F Street, NW"", you should wait for the Uber car at the hotel's rear entrance.]The hotel was in walking distance to the National Mall and the White House, although Lincoln Memorial was beyond a short walking distance. We took an Uber car ride from the hotel to Lincoln Memorial first. After visiting Lincoln Memorial, we walked to the impressive Korean War Veterans Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, World War II Memorial, and Washington Monument before returning to our hotel for lunch. After lunch at the Hamilton, we visited impressive National Art Gallery.I would highly recommend this hotel.The hotel is nicely appointed and in a superb location. The bar is fantastic.Beware of their promises. They advertised and confirmed several months ahead, in writing, a suite for us with a ""stunning view"" of the Washington Monument. See the photo from our window of the essentially nonexistent view. When we asked about the discrepancy between their promise and what they provided we were told a suite with a view of the monument would be at an additional room charge of 50% more! Classic ""bait and switch."" They also promised a bottle of wine to be sent up but seven hours later it didn't arrive without an additional call.Beware that this hotel makes misrepresentations in its advertising and confirmation letters and beware of bait and switch."

The bathroom was looking tired and again cleanliness was an issue. See pictures of dirt on hinges, dust on vanity, mould on the bath seal and missing tile grout.On our first day the room was serviced but the used dirty cups were not replaced, the coffee was not replenished nor was the bathroom tissue.

The moment you walk in it hits you with the elegant large marble columns and takes you back in time. The Christmas directions made it even better! We stayed in a superior king room and it provided much more space than we would think. Great plush bed and the room was very clean! Only gripe is that there was no complimentary water provided. All in all great hotel to stay in with so much history...also top notch breakfast buffet which was included in our stay apart of my paid package! 2 blocks from the White House! It’s a must stay!We’ve stayed at a few hotels in DC and the Willard was highly recommended so we tried it out over Christmas, 2017. It was fine, but I would not say that we would definitely return. The staff was very friendly and helpful, but the accommodations were not spectacular. We did not realize you could not enter from the back before checkin and the signs were not clear on where to enter so on a cold day we walked around the block to find the entrance. The lobby was very crowded with not much room to stand and the checkin was not very fast. The room was fine, but we’ve had better. There is no refrigerator as it is a minibar and they charge you $30 to empty it so we did without. It turns out that even setting our thermostat on 70, the back part of the room stayed in the low 60s (including the bathroom) so our drinks were fine, but this is certainly not a complement. The fitness room was above par, but overall, I would say the hotel was average."

The hotel is an easy five minute walk to Metro Center which means a one train ride to Union Station, Reagan Airport and most other parts of DC. Nearby are a number of restaurants and bars (the Hamilton across the street is a personal favorite) plus some coffee shops and fast food places. Hotel: In a word: gorgeous. A beautiful classic building exuding old world elegance but still modern and comfortable. There are entrances on both F and Pennsylvania though Pennsylvania is easier to get picked up or dropped off on. The lobby has several shops inside an arcade which right now look amazing for Christmas. There are also several restaurants and bars there. Check In: Handled really well by an agent who actually appreciated my IHG Platinum status which isn't a given at ICs. He also gladly confirmed a 2 PM check out for me which is better than the 12:30 PM my status guarantees. Room: I had used an IHG CC Cert to reserve a Deluxe Room with two queen beds and received room 845 which I think is an upgrade. As you can see it was a gorgeous room with a large bathroom with separate shower and bathtub, kitchenette, work/dining area and a really comfortable king bed. Everything worked well and I had a very nice stay.I love this hotel, it's one of the best ICs and a European feel in the US.I’ve stayed in more than 20 Intercontinental hotels globally, and based on my experience (5 night stay), I rate this one the worst. Every other Intercontinental has reconfirmed to me that choosing this brand is a safe bet. This one has put all that into doubt. It has also been worse than any other hotel I’ve stayed in in DC over the years. Yes, it has a fancy lobby. But as far as the rooms and the service go, it was a huge let down I’ll just list the issues:- I asked to change rooms after the first night because the bed was unbearably worn out. I felt like sleeping in a hammock, and tried to balance in the middle of the bed so I wouldn’t damage my back in the hollow on either side. - First room had serious mold in the bathroom. Second room still had, but less. Have never seen anything like this even in a 3 star hotel. - A dirty shoe print (??!) on the toilet seat in the first room, plus long dark hairs in the wash basin (I’m short haired blond). - Overall bad state of repair and careless superficial fixes.- Coffee maker in second room was broken and unusable. - Nobody available to help me with luggage at both check in and check out. So I carried it up and down the stairs myself. - Twice got a call at 5am or so which hung up when I had woken up and answered. No, I had not asked for a wake up call. - One day, cleaning staff entered room unannounced while I was in my underwear. Yes, I had not put the lock on or dnd sign out, but why would she just stomp in at 2pm? The room was already made up, and it was too early for turn-down. - Ambassador upgrade possibly takes you from a larger room to a much smaller room “with a view”, as happened to me. This seems to be a common Intercontinental feature though. - Generally uninterested staff. They did nothing wrong, but certainly did not leave any positive impression either. - At check out I had to fight my way out of extra charges: My rate included breakfast, but I was charged a breakfast bill on top of that rate for every day, even though I always told the wait staff that I’m on an inclusive rate. They said it will be reimbursed. I'm holding my breath. Generally, I wouldn’t consider the breakfast worth it’s price, unless your employer covers an inclusive rate."

Arrival from DCA was relatively painless and quick via Lyft at about $13. Check-in was friendly and efficient from a trainee who appeared to be reading from a script and not quite sure of himself but very eager to inform and help, nice start. The room we got was a Deluxe High Floor which I am not sure if they consider the high floor aspect an upgrade but dont consider it much of one myself as the high floor view was of the JW across the street. It was not a big deal though as the standard room is really large and well appointed. If you are the type of person that likes modern decor, this isn't for you. The room and hotel has a ""classic"" decor and theme. The room was clean and comfortable so no complaints about it at all. The bathroom was big and the shower had good pressure. There was also a Illy espresso and coffee maker in the room which was nice. We took a peak in the Round Robin bar but seemed packed and while I appreciate the historical nature of the bar...the cramped quarters wasn't for us. We did dine at the Cafe associated with the hotel and it was pretty good (reviewed separately) with a really good breakfast. Not cheap but good.All in all, we enjoyed our stay. I dont know that it it will make me dump my usual place for stays in DC but definitely do not regret the stay. Will definitely not rule out returning."

The bathroom was well appointed with excellent shower pressure and plenty of hot water. There was definitely some wear and tear evident in the room (desk and bathroom cabinet), but I easily overlooked this as everything else was stellar. I did not use the mini bar, but ordered room service. To be quite honest this was was exorbitantly priced, but understandable due to the location.I was very pleased to be accommodated with a late check out and found all of the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful.

The atmosphere is right, the staff is friendly, the rooms have great views (ask for premier king) and the breakfast ladies are lovely, making your breakfast a memorable one, especially with the French toast sandwiches :-)I stayed at the Willard this past Friday (stop on my way to SC) and my biggest regret is that I couldn’t spend at least another night here! It was a beautiful hotel with the best staff. The room was huge and felt like a second home. They definitely make you feel welcome and at home here. Plus the downtown area is about a 10-15 minute walk. We checked in late around 8PM (which was not an issue FYI) and walked into the downtown area. I saw so many great reviews about this hotel and now I can see why! There’s a nice bar and restaurant on site that ties it all together. Although it was a historic building it was still very quiet and air/temperature control was perfect. Valet parking was available which made our stay a breeze!"

The hotel was amazing! Absolutely gorgeous lobby welcomed us after the flight and the staff could not have been nicer!Housekeeping was wonderful and always welcomed us down the hallway. The room had exactly the view we were promised when booking - a gorgeous view out over the city with the Lincoln Memorial off in the distance, and it glowed beautifully at night out our window!The room wasn't huge, but we didn't expect it to be. But it fit a family of four comfortably for five days, was very clean, and with elevators at both ends of the hallway, easy to get in and out of the hotel.The location couldn't have been better for our daily excursions. We were able to hit so many of the museums and memorials and everything was within an easy walk or quick cab ride from the Willard.Couldn't have asked for a better hotel experience in DC!"

Situated in walking distance to most Smithsonian Museums and monuments. It's a 5-10 minute taxi ride from the bus/train interchange. Upon arrival, check-in was a breeze with a trainee Michael explaining what The Willard had to offer us as IHG members. All staff we encountered were amazing; I have to particularly mention Michael the concierge we dealt with, what a delightful gentleman. He organised two tours especially for us on a moment's notice. Both tours he booked for us were the highlights of our four day stay. If you have an interest in African American history the new museum is a must see. Likewise the visit to Capitol Hill and the tunnel connecting the Library of Congress a real bonus."

The location is second to none. Our view of the Washington monument was superb. No noise from other rooms and courteous Housekeeping. I arranged for a night pedicab tour that picked us up from directly outside the hotel which was very convenient. Our White House tour started a 3 minute walk from the historic hotel lobby. There are many coffee shops an easy walking distance from the hotel, as well as established restaurants. The walk from the Supreme Court to the hotel took us about 40 mins with a child in tow. Lincoln memorial is a 30 minute walk. Easy check-in and check-out process.No free bottled water in the room was disappointing upon arrival. The Staff did not openly point out facilities and where breakfast was in the morning or what it cost. The ground floor layout is odd, so it's not obvious where things are. Apparently there was a bar, but we weren't told about it. The Doormen only helped open a door once during the entire week, even when there were multiple available. At a hotel of this calibre, I do expect someone near the door at all times, not just standing guarding the left luggage.Dinner at Cafe Du Parc was so so. Smokers milling about the front entrance to the Willard polluted the air. The burger was good, but the mussel dish had several closed and broken shells."

As residents of the District, we decided we needed a 'staycation' just before the 4th of July. It was fun to be greeted by the doormen with a 'we hope you had a good trip in' when we arrived. Yes - we did. A 15 min Uber ride. The hotel is even nicer in person than in photographs. The opulent lobby is very impressive. The ceiling is adorned in State seals. Service is impeccable. Our check in only took minutes, and our bags were waiting for us when we got of the elevator. Enormous room with very comfortable bed/bedding. Top notch amenities in the room, the mini-bar, the coffee maker and the bathroom. While this is an historic property, our room was fresh, modern and the WiFi worked flawlessly. We enjoyed 'breakfast in bed' room service two mornings. Everything was delicious, especially the coffee. One checklist item we had: enjoy a mint julep in the Round Robin bar. Well worth it! Particularly on a hot summer's day. I'm a history buff, so enjoyed the old photos of president's, historical information around the hotel. The Willard is now one of my favorite places we've stayed. Can't wait to return for another staycation!"

We needed an overnight stay for a show, so we can enjoy a long evening, not rush/drive under influence to get home. After years of busy-busy life, it was a great experience, largely enhanced by the Willard, to be in the City: after so long of not paying attention to landmarks and surroundings it felt almost like taking a trip abroad! The location of the hotel is excellent, with many restaurants (and of course, the Mall, museums, etc) withing a short walking distance. We took a couple of long walks, and also jogged on the Mall in the morning, all were pleasant and interesting, plus a fabulous meal in a nearby restaurant, and a show at DC Improv. Parking in the building, but not free, nor validated for overnight stays. Which was a bit weird. If you park in their garage, but don't stay at the hotel - parking can be validated at a cafe that's in the building (excellent breakfast BTW, but not included in the room rate). The parking attendant informed me of elevator bank being repaired, and helped carrying the little luggage I had to another elevator bank. They will bring the car up front, when you leave. The King room was very comfortable, spacious, and well-appointed. Coffee (espresso or regular) and tea (Jasmine tea was great!) in the room, mini-fridge, all the bathroom goodies. We paid a decent fare for this room (maybe we got it ""on special offer""), but did not totally break the bank. Noise level is quite acceptable, average or lower than expected for a city-center location. The hotel itself seems to be a perfect venue for special occasions, and we enjoyed the atmosphere. Too bad our time there was a little short - did not explore the whiskey bar. There are several other hotels in the buildings right next to the Willard, so options are there, but we were happy with our choice. We had no issues at reception when checking in, or leaving. Pleasant service."

However the same cannot be said for the room I understand this is an old hotel and they are trying to keep it as classic as possible. However, there is a difference between classic old room and a room that is dirty and falling apart. The caulk sealing in the bathroom were peeling off (gross!). One of the coffee mug in my room was cracked at the rim (almost cut my lip). The outlets in the room were either broken or loose. The outlet in the bathroom was so loose that the hair drying plug fell out more than 10 times as I was trying to dry my hair. The fridge they send to my room had stains all over it, I had to use the towels to clean them up. Most of the time when I tried to call the front desk, the line was busy. When I called to have my room clean, upon my return, it has not be cleaned. I am not sure if my room were particularly bad since the reviews I read prior to booking are amazing. Having stayed at over 100s hotel in the world, I am quite shock at the quality and service of the hotel. The location cannot be beat and the lobby is beautiful."

First, you are literally the White House's neighbor! The hotel is 200 years old and is a Glamour of D.C. The rooms are gigantic! We had a room with 2 double queens and an adjoining King room and it was as big as a medium sized home! The rooms were VERY clean and well kept. Being completely central to the Smithsonian Museums and National Monuments is key! The staff is SO helpful. Eddie at the front desk is fantastic and the Concierge is amazing! They have an amazing Concierge service that caters to little one's and are so gracious and welcoming. I visited the Red Door Spa for a Manicure and Dalila was fantastic!

Close to the White house, monuments and museums. We were with teens and they loved getting around using the Capitol Bike share. We didn't eat at the hotel but went out the back door and up the street to the Corner Bakery which was delicious. We had a drink at the round robin and burgers one night at the Occidental.

The location can't be beat but service was a serious disqppointment. After a long stressful jouney to DC (our 9am acela train derailed just after departing penn station) I was looking forward to checking in and exploring the National Mall. We arrived at 2:30. The Gentleman at the front desk asked for my ID, told me only one of our two rooms was ready..and promised us ""a great room with a view and an upgrade""....after a pause stated that neither room was ready...suggested we leave a cell number so he could call us at 4 when room was ready. My cell phone rang at that monent (a relative calling to check on me having just learned of the train accident) . My teen son (who never notices these things) reported to me that he rolled his eyes and made a face like he wanted to get rid of us) when I answered the call. We left our bags with the bellman (who had not offered to help us bring our bags up the steps into the hotel) . We returned at 4:40 not having received a call at four. A different man at the front desk asked for my ID and said ""let me check with housekeeping on the staus of your rooms"" and shooed us away to sit in the lobby while he checked. He left the desk never to return. Ten minutes later at 4:50 I returned to the desk and a third person (a woman) asked me to show ID. When I expressed distress at having to wait so long for room to be ready she reprimanded ""CHECKIN IS AT FOUR!"" I said yes but it is FIVE now. Three separate front desk people were rude, condescending eyerollers. Perhaps the problem was the housekeeping department...which arrived to clean our room the next day at 5 pm (we were OUT of the room from 8 AM until 5PM). I am not sure if the rooms we gto were the promised ""upgrade"" ""view"" rooms. 1203 in the turret with portlhole hobbit windows would have thrilled me when I was 7 and liked Rapunzel..but I am 5'6"" and need to kneel to look out the window.We've stayed here numerous times in past and had great times. My wife showed up with one of my sons first and showed up at 2pm. They were told to come back at 4pm check in time. They showed up at 4pm and neither of our rooms were ready till 5pm. My wife and son had come by train (after their first train derailed!) and were exhausted yet the front desk personnel were very rude to them and one of them ""rolled his eyes"" when my wife asked again for their rooms at 4:45pm. One room for our sons was great. Our ""preferred"" room was low ceilings, dark, with only tiny porthole windows. There was a separate sitting room that was separated by a wall. Seems like the""preferred"" room was a former servants' quarters. The next day we were out at 8am and returned to our rooms at 4:30pm and our sons' room still had not been made up by housekeeping! I've stayed in 100's of hotels and never felt the need to post on trip advisor till now!"

Upon arriving and just by stepping into the hotel, my heart skipped a beat. The hotel is simply majestic and every inch of it has a historical memory. I was welcomed by a phenomenal team, lead by the Guests Relationships Manager.I was upgraded to the almighty Abraham Lincoln suite and I fell in love with every foot of this luxurious gigantic suite. The housekeeping team was super responsive although I didn't really need much help since everything was in the right place. I was surprised by a different gift every day.

This was not offered at check-in and not in this hotel but lately in some other IC chain hotels. I love staying in hotels as an Ambassador member so making this minor suggestion which leaves a major impression.

I imagine there have been many politicians making deals at this hotel through the years being that it is only a block from the White House. I decided on a trip to Washington D.C. because I wanted to experience it while President Obama was still in office. Check-in was quick and easy. I was asked by reception if I'd like 600 IHG reward points or a welcome gift delivered to the room. I told her to surprise me with the welcome gift. I settled into my room and was pleasantly surprised when room service bought a complimentary bottle of wine. I logged into the hotels speedy WIFI and a survey page appered asking how things were going so far. I wrote that the room was nice but as a Spire level member was hoping for a nicer view, as the view was of another building across the street. Five minutes later I received a call from Cynthia, the front desk manager, asking if I'd like to move to a suite and a better view. I was upgraded to a top floor corner suite, room 1200, with an incredible view of the Washington Monument, see attached photos, and to my surprise a view of the White House portico as well. Whenever I book a hotel I request a quiet room on a high floor with a view if possible. The view being the most important to me. I hit the trifecta with this upgrade, plus a suite as a bonus. I booked a walking tour where we were to meet in Lafayette Park behind the White House, I was running late but as it's only a 5 minute walk away I made it no problem. The tour stopped in front of the hotel where the guide told us of some of the hotels history. I will definitely return to the Willard Hotel on my next trip to Washington D.C. Thank you again Cynthia for the ""suite"" upgrade."

The main reason we picked the space was because of a recommendation from a coworker and the location. You can't beat the location. It's a close walk to all the Smithsonian museums and some decent restaurants. The staff are respectful and the room was always cleaned. On an number of occasions we were able to ask for umbrellas and they provided them to check out. The tv is a flat screen and is about 47"". The tv and remote are challenging to use as there's a delay that occurs after you press the remote buttons - not user-friendly in my opinion. As expected, the cafe and restaurant are overpriced (airport prices) and the quality is about normal. Feel free to visit the surrounding food venues outside of the hotel for a bite to eat. My wife and I ate at the Hamilton. The fitness center is decent. There's a free weight rack and around five machines. You can also find apples and water there. Although there were many positives and I'd stay here again, I'd like to point out why I deducted a star.There seems to be a fruit fly problem in my room. Every night I'd find myself swatting at a gnat or fruit fly or two that seemed to live in my room. It was annoying and I had to make sure to close up all food containers so I didn't encourage them to stick around. Also, the coffee machine was less than stellar. On a number of occasions I had to turn off the machine because it gave too much coffee or much less than the cup size. It's also one of the loudest coffee machines that I've come across. I wish they would have just bought a machine that accepts Kcups. Would have been much easier to use. Overall, it was a great trip and stay. Would be wonderful if the Willard would address some of the other issues."

Such a historic building should deliver an unforgettable experience harkening back to to its glory days. Sadly what we got was an old room with indications that it's cleaning regime was questionable. The main pieces were spotless (bed, bathroom, carpet etc) but things like the mini bar were incredibly dusty. It's the little things that make the difference. The A/C was awful and no matter how cool I made it, it never got colder (it took 8 hours to go from 72 to 70 during the night). Little things like the light switches were yellowed so much, they might be from the original remodel. I stayed with the hotel on points but if I would have paid the $280 for room rate I would have been livid. Iv been in better rooms at $99 Hilton Garden Inn's. Visit the hotel for tea or a meal but please don't stay here. It's a beautiful building and an over rated hotel.It's a gorgeous, classic hotel and at Christmas it is decorated beautifully.But you pull up and no one assists you with luggage. So we lugged our own bags through to the reception desk.Check-in was pleasant. We had two rooms, one was ready, the other wasn't. So they held the luggage for that room. They then delivered the luggage they were holding to a wrong room. We eventually got it sorted out, but that shouldn't happen.Round Robin bar is lovely, classy and expensive. Well-crafted drinks. Great atmosphere. I'd have cocktails here all the time if I lived in DC.Rooms were large, nicely decorated and very clean. Housekeeping did a very good job. Beds are comfortable: water pressure in the shower amazing. Room temperature can be hard to regulate but that may just be the perils of an old building.Our key cards for both our rooms stopped working the morning of checkout at 10 am. Annoying. Then our room rate was incorrect at checkout. I showed the confirmation of our quoted rate at the time of purchase and they adjusted accordingly, but again, these incidences shouldn't occur.The location is amazing, just a couple of blocks from the White House. Central to so much in DC.I'd stay again because nothing was awful, and it's such a stunning grand dame of Pennsylvania Avenue, but I hope the Willard starts getting the details right. It makes the difference between a very good hotel and an excellent property."

The Willard has an impressive history, which is on display in a walk-through history gallery. It is close to the White House and is only a seven-minute walk from the nearest metro station, making it in a perfect location for tourists exploring the city. The two of us stayed in a spacious king room. As IHG members, we got free WiFi for up to seven devices. A small bar area included complimentary coffee and tea as well as a mini-fridge stocked with soda, water, and alcohol for an additional fee (the bellhop warned us that the fridge was on a timer but told us to alert the reception desk if we wanted to store food). The bed was soft and comfortable. My only complaint about the bathroom was that the toilet flushed slowly and did not appear to be water efficient. The bathroom itself had ample counter space and beautiful marble floors and marble shower/tub. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had a packed agenda so didn't take advantage of the spa, but there is one on-site. We would stay here again without question is we could get it at an affordable rate again."

We had a great breakfast in the room. The hotel is beautiful. It is very well preserved and it has everything you would expect from a modern hotel without losing the old fashioned touch. The luxury is shocking.Famous old place needs more than just another refurbishing. We reserved a ""Premier"" room and were given Rm 315, which was barely a large closet, one bed, and one window that looked out on an air shaft. We called the desk -- ""Oh, sorry, you were given a ""deluxe"" room by mistake. We got moved to Rm 327, larger, but still on the shoddy side: pictures, wall scones, and switch plates crooked, a lamp in front of a picture, some switches that did nothing, lamps that had a hidden floor switch. The toilet seat was flimsy plastic, cheap single-ply toilet tissue, only a few hangers in the closet. After touring the city, we came bask to the room at 3:45 pm and it still wasn't made up.Ice from the ice machine down the hall was soupy and prices on items from the mini-bar were ridiculous (candy bar $4, pkg of nuts $12, soda $6, split of wine $30). Lots of famous people stayed here in the past but I don't think they would today. At the end of our 3 days, we were happy to leave."

First off, this hotel is in the heart of downtown, a single block away from the White House, and we could walk to 90% of the big attractions in 15 mins or less. Amazing!The hotel has an incredible, historic, grand look, with tall ceilings and chandeliers everywhere. The room was super spacious with extra sofabeds and lounging chairs to really help you relax. The floor to ceiling windows added to the charm of the room. I honestly could not say better things about the hotel service. Every single person was highly courteous, eager to help, and the response times were amazing! They gave us complimentary tea/coffee for every day we were there and the room service food quality like a 5-star restaurant. The bathroom had more than one gorgeous large mirror and big tub to accommodate even the taller folks. (The only flaw I found was the hair dryer provided was too old and not strong enough for my hair)Overall this is a great place for families and non-family travelers alike, and the price is definitely worth the service they provide. Highly recommended! :).My family and I had the great pleasure of spending a long weekend in the John Adam's suite at the wonderful Willard hotel. Certainly my best experience in DC, but equally, one of my best hotel experiences ever. The Willard is an obvious classic, well-placed hotel in DC near to just about everything. The history of this place is so rich and it engenders thoughts of our early Presidents coming here to drink and smoke cigars-in fact, the word “lobbyist” was first used here. The hotel maintains its classic appearance in both furnishings and feel. It is easy to imagine the Presidents, politicians and generals that walked these halls. You feel part of that historic scene that you would not feel in other hotels. The bar is amazing, and after all, they say the mint julip was invented here. My two older daughters had a memorable time at high tea. I was also very pleased that the staff at the front desk, the concierge, the waiters and bartenders all maintain a very high level of professionalism and class that you would expect at such a hollowed place. We had no issues whatsoever and all of our needs, from a rollout bed, to tooth brushes, towels etc. were always handled in a quick and efficient manner and our needs were anticipated in advance. Now let’s talk about the suite. I have posted pictures of the suite from every angle. It’s big, over 2,000 plus square feet. With one full bath and two half-baths, it is great for a party or gathering. Although we did a lot of sightseeing, we always looked forward to coming back to suite to relax, open a bottle of wine and entertain before going out to dinner. After all the walking, and nightlife, being in such a wonder roomy suite, made the trip so relaxing and took the edge off of our exhausting schedule. It was quiet, the bed was comfy and what a great a place to have breakfast in the “dining room.”! As you can see from the pictures, this is one wonderful place. The “bureau”, it wasn’t a desk, had a wonderful feel, and it made it easy to complete the little work I brought with me. PS. We had a great lunch on the patio at the Café du Parc, before leaving for the airport. I can’t wait to get back to this place."

Other thing I thought that was just really poor was the beer selection in the mini-bar ... Amstel light and Heineken - really? Is that really the best we can do?"

Check in was very delayed and we had a problem of smelling cigarette smoke in our room late at night and early in the morning. Mentioned it at check out because I did not want them to think we smoked (I'm very sensitive to it).

Nice large bathroom, in-room bar, coffee maker, large desk and sofa. I forgot my toothbrush and the front desk was more than willing to assist with both a new toothbrush and toothpaste oppose to directing me to the nearest store.I wish I had more than 1 night to have stayed here. There was a storm headed to the area but William was so helpful by checking for availability for an additional night just in case my flight was delayed. Luckily my flight did depart although 2 hours later than scheduled.We stayed in the Presidential Suite for a short visit to DC. The hotel location is superb and the history as well as common spaces are simply beautiful, however, there are some aspects which do not make sense to me. When staying in a suite this size one would think that someone would show us around, it was not the case and we had to call the front desk a few times to get the information (none of which was available in the suite). I think that management tend to forget that small things make a world of a difference ( a working toilet, a smoke detector hanging lose, just to mention a few). Try to get someone on the phone after 10:00 you are left hanging on the phone, our only way was to visit the front desk for questions/answers. After returning from a nice diner with friends in Georgetown the front of the hotel was very busy with simply one person to handle crowd. Management need to remind themselves that history is not enough to bring guests (all of them not just the customers who are renting a suite). When we left we asked the front desk to remove a parking charge which we did not use, instead of simply listening all we got was a front desk staff trying to argue the issue. While the experience of such beautiful building was worth the visit, I do not think we will return but rather look at the competition for better service."

Our room, number 332, was so spacious and reflected the historic character of the hotel. We enjoyed looking at the exhibits in the History Gallery - it was fun to see that ""Baby Doe"" and Horace Tabor, the silver magnate, had their wedding here, because we had visited the Tabor mine in Colorado, where she ended up living as a recluse in a tiny cabin. Fun facts! We also enjoyed a delicious breakfast the next morning - we're not big breakfast eaters, but seeing all the mouth-watering choices made it hard not to over-indulge!The only issue we had was the internet connectivity, but since I was on vacation, I decided to just let it go. I was able to respond to the one email I needed to answer. At checkout, the same person who checked us in asked if all went well, and I mentioned the internet drop, also saying it was not a big deal. He was so apologetic (wow!) and put some points into my husband's IHG account for the inconvenience. How nice! I only wish we had more time to enjoy this lovely hotel."

But I could give him a five star.  I have got a nice room on 4th floor (room 441). Room was very spacious (475 sq feets) and well decorated. I have got two queen size beds and very comfortable bed. Bathroom was very clean. I didn't know what is my room category. Breakfast at Café during Parc was good. Service was very nice. Buffet was good. Gym was spacious and good. Location is a top notch. Nearby with all museums and National mall. One block with The White House. There are many good restaurants nearby.

There website has a Best Price Guarantee or the first night is free with the words ""Book Online or Call 1-888 IC HOTELS"". While on the website, I called the reservation line and spoke with a representative to ensure I was getting the correct room that fit my needs. She offered to book the room for me and when I asked if there were any advantages or disadvantages to having her do it or my completing the reservation online myself, she specifically stated that there was no difference. I proceed to let her book the room. I found a significantly lower rate on a competitors website that night. I filled out the Best Price Guarantee claim form which was then denied. It was denied because I did not book online, but let their representative book over the phone. You can see in the picture below that there is nothing stating must book online for Best Price Guarantee. There is no asterik or drop down menu that would provide this important piece of information to a consumer making this decision. There is a drop down (+) directly above to show you the Top Destinations, but they have excluded this key information about the Best Price Guarantee from there booking page. Please beware about this misleading tactic. I hope my family and I enjoy our upcoming trip. We will not be staying with any hotel associated with this group for any future vacations as there guarantee is not what it seems and I do not wish to do business with companies that do not stand behind what they offer and use deceptive practices to mislead consumers.

However, this year I found that the quality had really gone down A LOT. First of all, when I arrived, I had a hard time finding a valet to park my car and no one helped me carry my suitcases up the stairs to the front entrance. I checked in, and was given a room on the 12th (top) floor. Turns out, the top floor was less like ""penthouse chic"" and more like ""Grandma's old smelly attic."" It was dark, musty, stuffy, and had only one, small, boat-style circle porthole window. And on that window, the caulk was so decayed it literally made a hole to the outside. You could see through it (see picture). Perhaps the lack of sealant is why the climate control system didn't work AT ALL. Despite the fact that it wasn't even that hot outside, my room was uncomfortably stuffy and hot my entire stay. No matter how far down I put the temperature, it stayed that way. It was like hot breath was coming out of the ONE vent. Trying to sleep in a stuffy box was a nightmare. This was compounded by the fact that the bed had no top sheet. Just a fitted sheet and then -- something I have seen more and more hotels do lately, WHY OH WHY, JUST STOP -- a dirty comforter sandwiched in between two sheets. No duvet. Just a comforter (and not the type you use as a standalone; the kind that needs a cover), with a sheet on top and a sheet below, wrapped around like it was a burrito. So when you move at all, and the ""cover"" sheets shift, you wake up touching a nasty, stained clearly unwashed comforter that is meant to be housed in a duvet. Why would you not cover that up the right way? The bed was also wholly uncomfortable. Overall, I think I slept a total of 4 hours the 3 nights I was there. I could go on. The cleaning left a lot to be desired (small hairs in the soap dish and large particles of something or other not vacuumed up when I arrived, etc). The room was noisy. Internet costs $16 a night despite the fact you are paying $400 a night for the room. In fact, none of this should occur EVER, but it definitely shouldn't when you are paying $400 for a room. The Willard needs to step it up. Don't think I have any desire to stay again."

My stay at the Willard was both business and leisure. After reading countless reviews I had high expectations for this hotel. Needless to say, 90% of these reviews are severely overrated. First, my check was delayed (30 min process) because the employee was having some difficultly with ""selecting a room for me."" I fully understand sometimes things happen, however, my issue was that my coworker who waited the exact same amount of time (with a different) employee was given comp drinks for his wait. When I asked if I could also receive a comp drink for my wait, the desk employee helping me said no. Needless to say I was a little taken back after watching my coworker receive comp drinks. Thus I went to the other desk employee and kindly ask her to provide me with a comp drink, and after another 15 mins of waiting she finally agreed to give me a comp drink. While that doesn't seem like much, unfortunately it only gets worse from here. Two days later I noticed that my comforter had numerous stains on it underneath the top sheet. After closer examination, I was able to determine that the comfortable had not been washed since the stain. See photos attached. In addition, the sheets and bed (comfort) were the two worst things. I have stayed in HIEs/Hamptons 100 miles from the nearest large city with more comfortable sheets & beds than this hotel. These rooms are out dated an in need of some serious TLC. Please do not let the location or name fool you, save your money and stay at the Crowne Plaza (closer to a metro station) or a Hilton property.I stayed at the Willard for the second time in December 2015 (first time was in March 2015). We organized a 2-day conference here. The best part about the hotel is its location which is 'prime', with respect to business as well as leisure. After work, we could just step out to walk around the White House, and shopping was also not an issue as there were a number of good stores in the vicinity. Staff, especially the events/catering guys are extremely courteous and always available to cater to your requirements. December, with Christmas round the corner, was really beautiful in and around the hotel. The lobby had a huge decorated Christmas tree. It was an amazing experience listening to the Christmas carollers, who sang at the hotel lobby in the evenings.Room are really big and spacious. The only thing that I did not like was that there were no tea bags (english breakfast tea/assam) kept in the rooms. There was only coffee and green tea options in the room. So, in case you would like to have your own bed tea in the morning, I suggest carrying your own preferred teabags along. Otherwise, placing an order for one is the only option.Overall, an excellent stay. Would recommend this to anyone who is visiting there on business or for leisure."

We called guest services and waited 20 minutes for a guest services manager to return our call, even though we specifically asked for them to send someone up to our room. The hotel's customer service manager's response was to send up the housekeeping manager and the housekeeper who cleaned our room, then asked for us to point out all the 'obvious' issues to both of them (housekeeper & housekeeping manager).

As an IHG Spire Elite member, I've stayed at hotels all the country and the floor in this hotel room is the dirtiest I've ever seen in ANY hotel I've ever stayed. For this to be a 4+ Star hotel and how they (1) presented this room to us and (2) how poorly they handled their mistake is ridiculous at best. This hotel has a great history and a beautiful lobby, so stop by and visit but there's plenty of wonderful hotels in the DC area. I'd suggest you look elsewhere to stay as this hotel didn't make the mark for me and my family during our holiday vacation."

No acknowledgement of Spire elite status at check in and was asked to pay to get upgraded. They acknowledge there are rooms facing the National Mall but those are reserved for paying guests (i.e. Those who give in to their upgrade fees offer).Save for this perennial bad (money sucking) habit, the hotel is a good one. May return, and now that I no longer expect any benefits as a spire member, might even enjoy staying here again next time."

Pretty pricey. Not sure if the price is worth it considering there were a lot of deals to be had that for some reason we couldn't capitalize on (not sure why). So we paid full price but still really happy over all with experience. That would be the only reason for not giving it 5 stars.

They are right next door to the legendary Willard Hotel. After dessert we ventured next door to check out the digs and the hotel was absolutely stunning. The staff at the front desk kept to themselves when our large group walked in. No one bothered us or asked what we were doing there. We were free to venture throughout the hotel lobby areas and peek into some of the ball rooms which were set up for some events and were dressed up pretty. We really enjoyed our time there and would definitely be staying at this hotel next time we visit the area in the spring. I especially loved the twinkle lights in front of the hotel. Exuberant ambiance overall!

The card, champagne, and strawberries were a huge surprise to me, and especially to my girlfriend. We can't say enough how much that meant to us. The room itself was beautiful and we will absolutely be staying at the Willard again when we decide to spend the night in DC.Thanks to William, the front desk staff, the room service guy, and everyone for helping make our anniversary special."

Needless to say we absolutely loved the view.Check-in was friendly and efficient, Service was very good, but somewhat inconsistent... they skipped turndown service one night, didn't replenish bottled water on a daily basis. Small things which cannot take away the pleasure of staying in such an iconic hotel, nevertheless issues that surprised us. All in all we would definately consider staying again if/when in the area, and recommend everyone to experience the Willards grandeur at least once in their lives.My husband and I blocked rooms at the Willard for our wedding guests and we also held a brunch the following day. I’ll start with the positives – the rooms are wonderful and we heard from several of our guests how much they enjoyed the hotel. My husband and I stayed in the Roosevelt Oval room suite which I thought was spectacular. We even heard some great feedback about the staff and how helpful they were. Of course, the hotel is in a great location and is quite beautiful. Our guests were able to walk easily to many sights in the area. Some of the negatives: my husband and I had tickets for our wedding guests for the top of the Washington Monument tour. I labeled each envelope with the name of the guest and the day that they were to check in. I was assured that the guests would get the envelopes when they checked in. When I checked with some friends and family to see if they received their envelopes, they said no. So of course this required several phone calls and unnecessary worry on top of the usual hectic schedule a bride has to go through on their special weekend. Ultimately, there was no explanation to why this didn’t go as planned. The day after our wedding, we had a pass through brunch in our suite so our friends and family could stop by through the morning and eat, socialize, and say goodbyes. Our suite had a separate dining room which we used to set up our pass through brunch and the oval room was perfect for people to have a comfortable, elegant, and intimate room to hang out in. Overall, the brunch went well the set up and quality was very nice – just what we were hoping for. The negatives: the dining service was supposed to be setup by 8:30AM but no one was there by 8:40AM so I had to call to see what the delay was as guests were expected to show by 9:00. They were still setting up some last minute details when people were arriving at 9:00AM so that was a little disappointing. Also, at check out you don’t get the dining services bill so I had to email Ms. Ozga. When I emailed inquiring about the final bill amount I was sent an invoice only to find out that I was charged more that what the invoice outlined. I was then sent a separate email with what the “final” invoice was. Not sure why that wasn’t sent the first time, again causing unnecessary confusion and stress about why the charges were off. Overall, while it can be on the pricey side, I would recommend the Willard for your wedding guests but I do think there can be some kinks they could work on ironing out to make it a truly flawless and memorable event for you.FYI, my husband and I married in April and had our reception in September. Below is my review of our wedding night stay in the Jenny Lind suite on our wedding night:My husband and I got married in April - it was a small civil service with a couple of family members present. We wanted to go all out and have a romantic stay at the Willard so we stayed in the Jenny Lind suite the evening on our wedding night. The suite is very pricey but it has awesome views of the Washington Monument and Capitol building in the distance. There is a wonderful shower and jetted tub and they delivered some champagne and chocolate covered strawberries which was perfect. We also ordered room service for breakfast which was delicious!Some drawbacks: while the suite is very romantic there are some stains on the drapes flowing off the poster bed. Also, the main complaint is that we didn't get a ton of privacy - we had a phone call to the room where there was no answer on the other end, mid-day/early evening someone stopped by (I think for turn down service perhaps? Maybe you need to put the do not disturb sign on the door as soon as you get there?), another person stopped by the following day before we checked out to see if anything was taken from the minibar (this can't wait until after check-out?). I think we still made a good choice staying at the Willard but I think I would put the do not disturb sign on the door immediately and ask for no phone calls to come through if you are looking for privacy. We will be staying at the Willard again in September for our wedding reception - hopefully won't face the same issues."

However, once we got up there with our luggage, we quickly realized that the closet space just was not sufficient. I guess they installed room safes in each closet, and in doing so, they eliminated almost 24"" of closet space. Now, if this was a quick 2 or 3 night stay, we might have managed. But this was a week long stay, with many meetings on capitol hill. We called the front desk and a wonderful young lady named ""Cinthea"" helped us find a room with much more closet space. We ended up on the 12th floor in room 1229 which afforded much more closet space for suits, dresses and gowns. Room service was top notch, each morning we ordered 2 large pots of coffee, 2 glasses of orange juice...and the bill was $47. Reasonable, given the location of this hotel.All the hotel staff were very efficient, courteous and professional. They make your needs of utmost importance.This hotel sits right on Pennsylvania Ave and is walking distance to everything. There was only one slight glitch and that was the little gift shop in this hotel. The cashiers there were different each day and spoke little to no English. This results in an awkward exchange. I discovered that I had left a package of mints behind, and went back the next day with a receipt....zero help. Everything in there is extremely high priced. A package of dental floss was $4.89!Most historic hotel in DC. Everything was first class. Not for those on a budget but compared to others in this price range it's acceptable. Its location is central to all the best sites in the national mall. Not all rooms view the Whitehouse even from top floor."

It just so happens that the Marriott was booked (which thoroughly angered my father who was a platinum member at the time). I suggested The Willard, and that's where we ended up staying. I will say, the lobby is fantastic and I love the bar. Also, the decor in the ballroom is amazing as well. I love the old school elegance. Now, the first room we got was accommodating to the amount of people we had (4). We had two full bathrooms and enough bed space for us all as well as a great view of the White House. Unfortunately our first room did not have wifi and after numerous attempts to fix the issues, the hotel had to move us. This may seem like a minor issue but when your away and still need to complete things for work, you need wifi! Next, we were moved to the same type of room on the next floor up (I believe this were corner suites). This room didn't have air conditioning! So yet again, we got moved. This time they moved us to the George Washington suite. It is a beautiful suite, but unfortunately didn't have the appropriate accommodations for four people. There was only one full bathroom attached to the single bedroom in the suite (so imagine four people sharing one shower which is attached to someone's bedroom). Also, there wasn't enough bed space, so one of us slept on the couch and the other on a pullout. Personally, I don't want to spend that much money and have someone sleeping on a couch!!!!On our last day, as we were coming back to pack up and grab our items, we noticed that water was pouring from the bathroom ceiling! Thank god we didn't leave any of our items in the bathroom! When we alerted the staff, the only response we got was ""hmm that's interesting, there's no bathroom above that part of your room so I wonder where the water is coming from."" How could that be your only response?!!!When we checked out, we were told that someone would contact us about the issues we had but nobody ever got in touch with us. Also, our stay was in July of 2014 not 2015. So imagine, a year without anybody reaching out. We were planning on coming back to the Willard for a trip within the next month but I guess we will go back to the JW."

It was very grand and luxurious, but as to be expected for a suite. Despite the holiday weekend, it didn't seem to be too crowded. There were views to the street below, but nothing spectacular. The hotel exudes old world elegance and attracts an older crowd. The younger & hipper crowd may prefer staying at the W right next door, but the location is fantastic.It is spitting distance from the White House (literally a block away) and around the corner is the Old Ebbitt Grill. It was an easy walk to the Washington Monument and once you hit the monument, it was about another 10 min. walk to reach Constitution Gardens & the Lincoln Memorial. The closest metro station is the Metro Center Station which is approx. a 5 min. walk and an easy walk to a few restaurants, shops, and the Spy Museum.If you want a ride, there were always plenty of cabs & taxis waiting out front. There is also a stop for the Big Bus Tour & other hop-on/hop-off bus operators right in front of the hotel, which makes it super convenient if you're taking one of these buses.The service we experienced from their front desk, bellmen, concierge, to their restaurant was all very good. We ate breakfast at their in-hotel restaurant, Cafe du Parc, each morning and they also offered a decent buffet breakfast selection. I enjoyed our stay and loved our suite and you can't beat the location.This place is amazing literally located a block away from the white house. Walking distance to the national mall.

If you sign up for the hotels rewards program, wifi is complementary. Our 5th floor room was bright & spacious allowing plenty of room for both of us. We had an ""interior"" courtyard view from the large windows. The brightly colored umbrellas from the restaurant were pretty as well as the extensive landscaping. The elevators were always fast, housekeeping services were great & the staff friendly & attentive. The most spectacular part about the Willard (besides it's prime Pennsylvania Ave location) is the lobby area (along with the common spaces). Wow. This is old DC with ceiling medallions depicting each state, incredible, fragrant floral displays that are changed every 2 days & crystal chandeliers. They didn't coin the term ""lobbyist"" at the Willard for nothing. I highly recommend this hotel & hope to visit again someday."

Close to WH and a lot of other great sights in DC. You will find that the duParc restaurant leaves a lot wanting from a 4.5 / 5 star hotel. Staff is great but offerings are limited at the restaurant. I stayed in a deluxe king room that didn't have a great view, but that is fine because didn't spend much time in my room. However, some other family members stayed in a larger room that we thought was going to be even nicer--- when they got to the room there was just a very small window (a little larger than size of about an airplane widow) too high from the ground to see anything!!! Very disappointed. We didn't say anything and just dealt with it. Ask about two only the view but the size of the windows before you arrive!!!Lastly, a lot of the rooms are connected and the insulation of the doors which separate the rooms are not insulated properly.

From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left we were treated like the first family. We were travelling on vacation for a few days and we found the Willard on-line. We used some travel points and paid a few dollars to upgrade to “Ambassador” members of the hotel chain. We originally booked a suite and an adjoining room, a request you would not think was too much to ask for most hotels. I can tell you with a great degree of experience, this is the biggest bait-and-switch trick for hotels. They promise adjoining rooms and when you arrive they put you on different floors. Not bad when you are travelling with adults, but with teenagers, you lose a lot of sleep.The Willard was on the ball, they gave us the room type we booked, and the rooms adjoined and they upgraded us to an Oval Suite to boot. We literally had more room in the hotel suite than we do at home.The room was spotless, every detail was covered, and the housekeepers didn’t miss a beat. The front desk was attentive and went the extra mile. Even though the Internet connection was painful, their immediate apology and acknowledgement was a stark contrast to the usual excuses and trying to shift the blame to my equipment or the operator.Check-in and check out was a pleasure. The front desk staff knew their stuff. The bellmen were attentive, efficient and a pleasure to deal with.The Concierge was amazing. Full of helpful tips and advise, quick to drum up a reservation and tickets to local attractions, we could not say enough about Michael. He even helped us when an outside vendor turned out to be less than co-operative. The beds were comfy, the amenities plentiful and the stay was the most enjoyable we have had in a very long time. I highly recommend the Willard, it is way easier and cheaper than running for President to stay at the White House.Gorgeous accommodations and impeccable service await you at the Willard!

We have stayed in a Southwest corner executive suite, the Lincoln suite and the Theodore Roosevelt suite, aka oval room suite. My order of preference, the Theodore Roosevelt suite, the executive king SW corner suite, and then the Lincoln. Mainly because of the view and size. The Lincoln suite faces the back of the hotel and, therefore, though it is nice, I would prefer a smaller room with a view of the Smithsonian (south side).Hotel:It is a beautiful hotel with a great location just a block from the White house and the Smithsonian. Public transportation, or the subway, is not so convenient (not terribly far either but..) so if you are looking to leave the area beyond a walkable distance, it will most likely be by cab/Uber. National airport is close by, about 20 dollars by taxi. About $28.00 by black car Uber.The have a great bar, not very big and gets crowded at certain times but it has a great atmosphere. There restaurants are nice as well and there is outdoor seating which is really nice to eat, enjoy the weather and watch everyone.Rooms:As stated, the rooms are really very nice. Ask for a higher floor with a view of the Smithsonian. I wasn't a big fan of the Lincoln room because the view is of the back of the hotel--who wants that! I might actually ask for the Jefferson suite next time, since it was right across the hall from the Lincoln suite, meaning it has a Smithsonian view. The executive suites are beautiful as well and sufficient space for two people. I loved our corner suite and would be thrilled in that as well again.Hotel Service:Every time that we have been there, they have been really accommodating. Actually doing everything to help make our stay perfect. In March, we had the kids and groom service brought extra blankets and pillows as well as ice cream and who knows what for the kids so they could have a special movie night. They were over the moon. The next day, we had breakfast in the dining room and the kids really felt special. The other two times, it was just us, and they really do bend over backwards to make everything run smoothly. If they can accommodate an early arrival, they will.The only caveat that I have– the doormen. The last two times that we have been there, I have had to open my own door, get out of the car without help, and no one asked if I needed a cab. I know it sounds spoiled but at the Willard, especially when they are talking to each other and not helping anyone else, it is not what should be happening. And I had my hands full, which made it more frustrating.We travel to DC a lot and have been in many hotels and I must say that I like the Willard the best. It fills up fast, so book early. And if you don't succeed at first, it does have cancellations, so try the same day, sometimes you get lucky."

My boyfriend and I had gone to Washington, DC for a function and had tried to book The Fairfax Inn but it was sold-out. The Starwood's agent sold me on The W. We stayed there for two miserable nights at The W (check out my review for the tawdry details) when we packed up and moved next door to the historically significant The Willard. The reason I had not looked into The Willard initially was because I thought it would be too pricey. Turns out it was nearly 40% less than The W for a nearly twice-the-size room that was beautiful and gracious. I LOVE The Willard and can't wait to stay there again."

We wanted to go all out and have a romantic stay at the Willard so we stayed in the Jenny Lind suite the evening on our wedding night. The suite is very pricey but it has awesome views of the Washington Monument and Capitol building in the distance. There is a wonderful shower and jetted tub and they delivered some champagne and chocolate covered strawberries which was perfect. We also ordered room service for breakfast which was delicious! Some drawbacks: while the suite is very romantic there are some stains on the drapes flowing off the poster bed. Also, the main complaint is that we didn't get a ton of privacy - we had a phone call to the room where there was no answer on the other end, mid-day/early evening someone stopped by (I think for turn down service perhaps? Maybe you need to put the do not disturb sign on the door as soon as you get there?), another person stopped by the following day before we checked out to see if anything was taken from the minibar (this can't wait until after check-out?). I think we still made a good choice staying at the Willard but I think I would put the do not disturb sign on the door immediately and ask for no phone calls to come through if you are looking for privacy. We will be staying at the Willard again in September for another special occasion - hopefully won't face the same issues."

We would have liked more fun facts available throughout the hotel to match the lovely paintings and décor. There is a lot of street noise in the day, but improves by evening. One has the option to purchase a breakfast package, with the meal provided by the adjoining café. This offering was excellent providing fruit, cooked-to-order eggs and more. We found it very odd that no soap was provided. Certainly not a high-class move for a hotel of this caliber. Desk staff is excellent."

We arrived early on the day of our booking due to having a White House Tour commencing at 8.30am. Due to traffic hold up's and weather we were running late, as the security point for the Tour was across the road from the hotel I suggested to my husband for him to jump out of the car at the hotel and at least make the tour, I would check in and look after our young son. As I pulled up my husband rang to say security at White House had advised that if my son and myself could get over in the next 10 minutes they would still let us in. So i try to quickly explain to the gentleman at valet my situation could we unload the bags and secure the bags inside and could they leave the car for 30 minutes? or could they park the car down in the car park and lock up and we would check in on our return - Now I don't know if I was speaking a foreign language but I was meet with a blank look! you could tell he just did not understand a word I said, and told me to go and park the car in their garage myself! fortunately the gentleman who hails cabs saw my distress and came over to advise this would be okay to park the car in their car park and secure our valuables inside in the safe. Due to the fact I didn't have a room number he took my name - he couldn't even write my name (and it is quite a simple surname). No thanks to this my son and I were able to get across the road and commence the tour, was not a good start. Then when we came back an hour later they could not find our car!! my husband had to go down with one of the managers to the garage to find it! - inside fortunately was our luggage. The room itself was nice and spacious - with everything you would expect for a hotel of this level. Like many hotels it does supply a fridge but comes with a big sign saying if you move anything it automatically charges to your room! - I contacted the front desk as we need to use at least partial part of a fridge as my young son has special needs and we need to refrigerate medicines and supplements. Front desk were very good and said we could make as much room in the fridge as required with no issues.We did not dine in the hotel or order room service so can not comment on this. I found the staff I encounter in the hotel were pleasant and friendly. The valet team are another issue - the next day we took our car out to visit the Air Museum near the airport - due to it being a rental and having issues we swapped vehicles at the rental place near the airport. When we returned to the hotel that night the valet people just could not accept that we were already checked in and had been out for the day! - they keep saying 'checking in?"" No already checked in - tried to give us new tickets - it just seemed to baffle them that we would go out for the day in our car! My husband decided it wasn't worth trying to explain the swap of cars that probably would have sent them (or us! lol) over the edge. English appears to be a majority of the valet teams second language both in oral and written, this is something that perhaps needs to be addressed as we definitely were not the only people having difficulty.I can't put my finger on it besides the issue with the valet, we had no issues with the staff or our room, but the hotel just felt soulless, no atmosphere, very cold."

What a great trip! One of the main reasons for booking the Willard is that they are dog friendly. I didn't want to leave our beloved Boston Terrier and the Willard allowed us to bring her with us. There is a flat fee of $200 regardless of the number of nights. It was worth it. Our room was #508 and it faced the Washington Monument. Because of my IHG Ambassador status and the kindness of Cintia, we were upgraded to a junior suite. I love traveling with my son, but a junior suite gives us each a little privacy. The sleeping room was spacious but typical. The living room portion of the junior suite was large with a desk, bookshelves, built-in hutch for glassware and the minibar, a sleeper sofa, coffee table and end tables. Most importantly a door separating it from the sleeping area.The bathroom was just average. The trend in newer and newly renovated hotels is large and luxurious en suites. Having recently stayed at a hotel with this amenity, I find standard bathrooms unimpressive. The Willard's location puts you within walking distance to all the tourist destinations. There is a hop on hop off stop right in front of the hotel and you can buy your tickets from the concierge. These tour buses are a great way to see the sights. You can get off at a stop that looks interesting, then wait for the next bus to come around. We somehow finagled a reservation to the Christmas Day champagne brunch in Peacock Alley. The food was artistic, delicious and plentiful. However, I had two disappointing experiences with room service and Café du Parc. Room service: It was about 4PM and we had skipped lunch. We had dinner reservations at Old Ebbitt at 9PM, so I thought I'd order two kids chicken strips meals to tide us over. Blech! The ""chicken"" was mystery parts smashed together to resemble a chicken tender. Café du Parc: 2 of the 3 times we went were fine, but the 1 is what sticks out as negative. I was trying to order a plain coffee which means I pay and someone hands me an empty paper cup. The coffee is self-serve. Some guy in a suit was working on the front register and the two baristas seemed afraid to get in his way. I stood there for a really awkward amount of time feeling invisible before I finally got irked and left in a huff. Overall it was a wonderful experience, and I would stay there again."

Both stays provided an exceptional experience and not enough time (was there for work) to enjoy what the hotel truly offers, but will comment on what I was able to enjoy. The room was beautiful, very clean, and quiet. Although in a busy area, both times I have enjoyed a wonderful night's sleep in a very comfortable bed with equally comfortable pillows. Nice after a long day. Bathroom amenities are wonderful, and nearly every detail attended to. I do have one disappointment with the bathroom. For a beautiful room and bathroom, I was surprised to see a small, travel-sized hairdryer. Most hotels at this level offer a full-sized hairdryer, a much nicer option than the small, outdated one in my room. This is a minor detail, but noticed.Housekeeping, front desk, bell staff, all friendly, and wonderful to interact with. I do have one small detail when arriving to mention. I had a long travel day, with a delay and had looked forward to having my bags attended to upon arrival, as this location has stairs leading to the entrance to check in. The staff was in the middle of shifts, so I had to lift multiple bags up/down the stairs and to my room, as opposed to being greeted by anyone at the hotel. I searched for an alternate entrance and ultimately decided to carry them myself. Slightly disappointing. It was 11 pm and I was slightly exhausted by that time. That said, I love this hotel and would stay again and again. It was beautifully decorated for the Holidays. The lobby is amazing and entrance grand. I have attached a picture of the tree in the Lobby. Thanks again for a great stay, I will surely return!"

Overall just a very good hotel, very hard to fault and well worth the stay to sample Washington's historyThere may be minor flaws with this hotel in terms of service -- some of the staff can come off as apathetic to guest relations, seemingly because the hotel is just that special and has been for a very long time and as such the attitude at times, feels a bit, well, apathetic as I mentioned above. But in terms of beauty, historic value and location, the Willard can't be beat. I've stayed in several rooms, all beautiful.

For the most part we had a wonderful time at The Willard and loved the historic atmosphere. We had one very major issue (that I will detail below) but first the overall impression. We like to stay in historic hotels and understand the idiosyncraty that comes with older buildings. The Willard has the appearance of a 5 star hotel and there are areas where it suceeds but has several areas where it fails in that effort. First the good:I booked a basic king bedded room with the upgraded view of Pennsylvania Avenue. Since it was a special occasion I knew my husband would be very happy to look out over the Washington Monument (instead of looking out over another hotel building or drab courtyard that many reviewers posted about). We were given the room I booked, nothing special for the birthday celebration other than an acknowledgement by the front desk clerk in mentioning “happy birthday” to my husband. But that was fine, we are IHG club members but had no status in that program as we usually stay at Starwood hotels. The clerk did tell me that he had a very nice room on a high floor that he was sure we would like (it was on the 9th floor and did indeed have a nice view). The room wasn't large and only had one chair other than the desk chair but we made do with that. I usually don't accept rooms with connecting doors but since the view was nice I overlooked that (which it turns out was a major mistake). The room decor was nice and seemed recently refurbished.The front desk clerk was excellent, friendly and professional. He acknowledged our interest in the hotel history by providing brochures of the history, the state logos, and giving us a brief history lesson of the hotel as well. He offered us a choice of daily newspapers to be delivered to our room each morning and told us it was fine to request both the local paper and the NY TImes. Bell staff was friendly and greeted us daily. Housekeeping came at good hours and did a fine job of keeping the room very clean. The bed was comfortable, robes were waiting in the closet, good closet space and plenty of drawers. Coffee maker (real mugs not paper cups), extra glassware including wine glasses were in the room. Bathroom was not large but that is understandable in historic buildings. Bath toiletries were of good quality.We had room service for dinner a couple of times, the food was good and service was prompt.The lobby and common areas of the hotel are beautiful. The Round Robin Bar never disappoints. Wonderful ambience and the best Mint Juleps!Now the not so good:Since we took the Metro in from the airport we arrived on foot with our wheeled luggage. Apparently since we did not arrive at the driveway in a car or taxi we were ignored by the valets and no one offered to help us with our luggage which we had to carry up the front stairs by ourselves.No slippers in the room, but they were delivered upon request.Housekeeping was inconsistent on providing amenities, one day coffee wasn't replaced, one day toiletries weren't replaced, one day a wine glass went missing. Several days only one of the requested newspapers was delivered.Nightly turndown service is by request only and rather underwhelming. Wet towels removed, drapes closed, and two tiny chocolates on the bed. Other historic hotels that we have stayed in always provided some sort of ""goodnight card"" on the bed with the chocolates. Better 5 star hotels also provided fruit, bottled water, perhaps a daily weather forecast. A little touch of something to make you feel special that The Willard did not do. The InterContinental branding which seemed to dominate rather than the historic Willard brand. After that experience we did not request turndown again but one night they did it anyway.Now for the really bad:The security of our room was compromised by a room service waiter when he used our room as a staging area to serve dinner to the guests in the suite next door (through the connecting door between our bedroom and their suite dining room).After an evening out we returned to our room around 10 pm, looking forward to relaxing with a bottle of wine. When we got off the elevator we saw the door to our room was unlocked and propped open with the bolt latch. At first we were afraid to enter but then heard sounds of a dinner party in progress. We entered out room and saw a room service waiter with two rolling carts in the middle of our room, the connecting door wide open as he was serving dinner to the guests in the suite dining room. My personal belongings on top of the dresser had been swept aside and he had placed wet glassware in puddles (which damaged one of my photographs that I had on the dresser). There was debris on the carpet (crumbs and paper). Our own glassware had been removed from the room. We have no idea how long this had been going on or if the connecting door had been left open so that the other guests had access to our room. My husband had left his Mac laptop plugged in on the desk and of course we had all our personal belongings in the room.We frantically ordered the waiter out of our room, made him lock the connecting door and remove his service supplies. He truly seemed confused that we were making a fuss. Apparently the hotel had not informed him that he was entering the wrong room and compromising our security in doing so. We quickly assessed that nothing was missing or tampered with and called the front desk to complain. The night manager also seemed perplexed but did apologize and asked if we wanted to move rooms. At that time of night the last thing we wanted to do was spend time packing and relocating. Although we were shaken by the incident and felt our security was violated at that point all we wanted was to relax with a glass of wine, but alas our wine glasses were missing. The manager offered to credit one of our bar charges from the Round Robin and then a bit later offered to send up a bottle of wine and a cheese platter. Finally after a second phone to find out when our wine glasses would be replaced (we already had our own bottle of wine) the manager and a room service attendant showed up at our door. While this was a nice gesture I really thought this type of unbelievable incident should have been acknowledged by some sort of phone call or note from the executive hotel manager the next day or in an email after we returned home but that didn't happen. And I also think some sort of points compensation should have been offered.I really wanted to love The Willard after the rave reviews I have read. For the past few of years we come to DC in the summers, previously staying the the St. Regis and the JW Marriott. Thiswas our first time at The Willard. I had hoped to make The Willard as our regular destination but after this experience I believe we will try someplace else next time."

I love the other Inter continentals I've stayed at but the one is over the top. I was blown away from the moment I walked through the door. The lobby is beautiful and really sets the tone for the entire stay. I can't believe I didn't get pictures of it but since you are already online just Google it. The pictures don't lie. The grandeur of the the main lobby was also reflected in the staff. From the valet parking, concierge and reception desk, everyone made me feel like they had just been waiting for me to show up.My room was mind blowingly incredible and I did take pictures. I stayed in the Abraham Lincoln Suite. I have no idea of the square footage but I have lived in smaller houses. I love the classic decor is warm and relaxing and did I mention spacious? My joke that puts the size into perspective, room service rang the door bell and I answered the wrong door. That really did happen. This room would be outstanding for a small group gathering. The dinning room, yes a separate room, has an 8 place table and chairs. A main/living room, 2 bath rooms, walk in shower. The bed room is larger than most European hotel rooms. (not the intercontinental in Frankfurt GE) Location, location, location. If you are just touring DC just leave the car. You can walk everywhere. Or if so inclined take a tour bus. However I enjoyed the walk. The hotel is about a 15 min walk from the Washington monument. Once you are there you are about a mile away in any direction form the Lincoln memorial, the White House, the capital, and the Jefferson Memorial. In between all that is WWII memorial, Vietnam, memorial, the Korean War Memorial. And museums galore.Without a doubt I will be back to the Willard. It is absolutely incredible."

Ample, well appointed, high floor.When we arrived (I didn't see any Elite or Ambassador check-in area, so we waited in line; there always seems to be a line) we were greeted by a very nice, friendly, and enthusiastic lady who explained that we had been upgraded to an Executive Suite, but it was not yet available (we were, as usual, very early), which is fine with us, so we had lunch with my partner and his spouse, and went for a walk.When we came back later in the evening, the nice lady was gone for the day and a gentleman had taken her place.Whereas the lady had been possibly the nicest person in all of DC, the gentleman was quite the opposite (OK, not necessarily nasty, but curt, unfriendly, and uninterested in making us feel welcome).I greeted but didn't get an answer. Was asked for ID and card in one short phrase, then the gentleman disappeared without a word. It was barely for a minute, and I am guessing he went to ask the housekeeping manager if the room was ready? No idea because no explanation was given. No acknowledgement of status, or upgrade, or comment about whether the reservation was paid for or not, or anything. Got handed a key and given directions to the elevator without another word (like username and password for the wifi, or lounge hours, or any interaction), not even a smile. Rather unpleasant, and definitely not a five star service.The room itself was, indeed, an upgraded Executive Suite. Odd layout, but nice. Large hallway, well appointed, separate bedroom and living-room, two full bathrooms (one of them with separate shower and bathtub, but strangely that bathroom belongs to the living-room area, not to the bedroom area), two full minibars, espresso machine, plenty of towels and bathrobes, two full closets (with each with a safe), work desk in the bedroom, dining area with table and chairs and resting area with sofa and TV in the living-room.The rooms at The Willard are nothing short of luxurious and I don't think I have ever had a problem with them.However, upon my arrival I realised that the flowers I had order in advance were not in the room (I did receive an email from the flower store confirming they had been delivered to the concierge) and my Elite Ambassador amenities were not in the room (and I was dying for a bottle of water).I called Guest Services and they informed me that the flowers and amenities had been sent to the Deluxe room, where my business partner and his spouse were staying (despite having made sure that the names were clear in each room, and the flowers being on my name), so I was left with the choice of the troll: look bad to my own couple (who was indeed expecting flowers and fruit) or look bad to my business partner that had received the items (his spouse loves flowers) and now was going to be robbed of them. Very uncomfortable situation to be in, but my couple comes first (at least in this case).On they sent someone to my partner's room to retrieve my objects. My partner let me know that they ignored the ""Do not disturb"" sign and didn't even bother to knock on the door before trying to open (fortunately, my partner had the top latch of the door on).I have no idea why but apparently three different people went to his room in three separate occasions in the next half hour.I don't think he'll be back.Two things I sorely miss in this hotel are a Club Lounge (they definitely have the space for it), and an Elite check-in area (the Front Desk is always too busy).As I said, despite having been my hotel of choice in DC for the past decade, I didn't have the best of experiences this time.I will probably come back, because the hotel itself is spectacular, and these seem to be punctual issues that I hope don't happen again.PS: I forgot to take decent pictures of the room, so I had to retrieve them from a video I recorded instead."

It continues to do so. The location, across from US Treasury and 5 minute walk to White House and Lafayette Square, is unbeatable.The rooms are kept up to date, but with period furnishings. Rooms range from compact (Holiday Inn size), to quite large (at least for a standard room, non-suite). Bathrooms are clean and up to date.Front desk personnel are ready to assist. We needed a rollaway in our room, and it was delivered within 15 minutes. (one of the best rollaway beds I have ever seen, by the way!)It's hard to go wrong with thise Grande Dame of DC!"

We spent one night at this opulent hotel so that we may enjoy the building's history. The Willard has a mini-museum to display its long rich history and note a few of the famous people who had stayed there. It was very interesting and well done.Upon arrival we met Mary Hapner, who had been my main contact when arranging our stay. She is an exceptionally kind and friendly manager who made us feel welcomed and appreciated every step of the way. The entire staff was an absolute delight.We were given an up-graded room (# 915) at check-in. The location was perfect. A high floor that was not on a street side, so the room was quiet. Our view overlooked the courtyard and the Willard as it wrapped around. The sunrise seen from that room was magnificent as the sun rose above the Willard's roof line.The room was immaculate. The all marble shower was huge. Water temp and pressure were consistent. The toilet flushed quietly (great for avoiding being woken by your neighbor's 3am bathroom visit). The towels and linens were all top quality and very soft. The bed itself was a huge King which was firm enough to offer support while soft enough to cuddle into at night. The complimentary in room coffee maker was a nice convenience. We did not partake in the fully supplied mini bar, but there was a little something there to suit almost any taste.Our stay at this regal hotel was one of the highlights of our brief visit to DC.When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted by Oliver one of the Porters who treated me like I was a member of the family and that I had been a regularly coming there for years. I was on the 11th floor. The next morning I had a lovely continental breakfast in their restaurant (Cafe du Parc), pity there were no offers on the price of the breakfast. If like me, you prefer a lighter breakfast, you can stay downstairs in the cafe and have a croissant or pain au chocolat and a coffee whilst overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, at a 1/4 of the price! The towels and amenities were replenished daily. The bed was really high, I felt like a kid having to jump onto the bed just to get into it! The room was relatively quiet in terms of noise from 14th street below. The Reception staff were brilliant as because of all the museums that I had visited my key card had become demagnetised and I couldn't get into my room, and they were more than happy to replace it, and again when I happened 2 days before leaving (I think that I had it too near my mobile phone). I also met Rene another member of the hotel's staff in Cafe du Parc. On the Sunday I had the pleasure in witnessing the attendees arriving for the 9th annual Cinderella Ball in aid of the children of military families with special needs and terminal illnesses. The in-hotel shop came to my aid when I had to buy a second bag for my carry-on luggage as I had overdone it with my shopping. Upon leaving I saw that Vice President Joe Biden was holding a lunch there. As I was leaving Oliver took my bags to the car for me. The whole experience was wonderful and I'm so glad that my first trip to DC was made even more special by the staff at The Willard! Thank You! The only down side was that out of the 4 guest elevators 2 were being worked on from Friday 6th June (but there are 2 more up some stairs down the every end of the corridor)."

The front desk attendants went out of their way to make sure all of our needs were handled, that we had the precise type of room we wanted and that our business was greatly appreciated. We ate at the Round Robin bar a few nights because we were sightseeing until late into the evening. The drinks were potent, the food delicious and the staff always smiled and could not do enough to take care of us. On each night we were asked by no fewer than 4 waiters if there was anything else we wanted.

We went for the Cherry Blossom afternoon tea, offered on select weekends. $48 per person without champagne.What disappointed me was the service and lack of attention to detail. At a world renown hotel, I expect attentive service. Unfortunately we experienced incredibly slow service, trust me, I watched the servers for two hours they were never hurried, and lack of attention to the little things that make a good tea service.Like other reviews have mentioned, you are seated at tables in a dark hallway, which was drafty and chilly today. I realized after today how much more I enjoy rooms with big windows, especially when enjoying a cup of tea. However, I wanted to try afternoon tea at The Willard and decided to take my Mom and sister for a birthday celebration.There were probably 6-7 others having tea once we were seated. It took about 10 minutes to get three menus, an additional 10 minutes for a server to return to take our selection, then probably an additional 10 minutes to get our tea. We were also given a 3 minute sand timer to use to know when to pour our tea (cute idea) so it wouldn't steep too long and get bitter. (So once you pour your first cup, the remaining tea in the pot WILL be bitter because it will be sitting there steeping. Might as well serve a cup at a time or strain all of the tea at that point.) Our handy 3 minute timer stopped halfway through, not so handy. I mentioned it to our waitress who told us to just shake it. Would have been helpful to know it wasn't reliable when she gave it to us. I know this is a little thing, but if you go through the trouble of giving a customer something to use, make sure it works or else don't give it to them, especially knowing it doesn't work. After we were done with our first cup of tea, (I had the Cherry Blossom tea which I found to be quite lovely) about 10 min later, our server returned to ask if we wanted cream or milk (and set down the jam/curd tray) 10 min later, really? Should have asked when the tea was served.Our food was served 20 minutes later. I had confirmed with the hotel the day before some dietary restrictions we had. They were also noted on the table card (good news) but they were not carried out (boo) so some of the food had to go back to be changed out. I thought the food was tasty, though the tiniest tea sandwiches I have ever seen. Our server did come back half way through eating to see if we needed more hot water. I felt bad asking for new tea altogether, but had to because what was left in my pot was bitter. She was very nice and changed it out. All the servers were nice. Just not very attentive, and really slow service. I am glad I went and can cross tea at The Willard off my to-do list, but it won't be something I return for."

The hotel is lovely and has been fully restored to its original 1850s splendor, only with modern amenities. The small historical gallery is quite worth the visit as you see The Willard through its many years on the Washington scene. The location is perfect for visiting the White House and the National Mall as it is literally two blocks away. Many other sights are also an easy walk. On the weekend, there was coffee in the lobby for early risers prior to 7 am when the cafes open. If you want a bit less pricey option for breakfast, the Corner Bakery is just across the street and delicious. The concierge was very helpful in assisting us with booking an airport shuttle when we completely forgot to do it until the last minute. The rooms are spacious and the beds are heavenly. Bathrobes are an especially nice touch. There is an Elizabeth Arden spa on the second floor and afternoon tea with a harpist on Sunday. The hotel lobby is simply sumptuous and is well worth a visit just to enjoy a step back to a more elegant time.As members of the Ambassador Club, we had a free night at an Intercontinental and decided to use it at the Willard.

Loyalty status recognized and rewarded with a huge suite...wow! Hoping I can stay here again in the future!!!During our two week trip in North America we stayed two nights on Priority Club points in the historic Willard hotel. We received numerous recommendations from friends and family so we did not have any doubt staying here.After a domestic flight we took a cab from Reagan airport which took under 20 minutes, the hotel is located within the city center and very near to the main museums and the White House.Upon arrival we were greeted by the bellman who assisted us with our luggage. The lobby is quite old but has a very impressive décor. During the check in process we encountered a small problem which after the help of the Front Office Manager, Mr. Bunnik, was immediately resolved. He was extremely kind, helpful and professional. As we arrived a bit early our booked room was not yet ready and the staff did not want us to wait too long for it so we were upgraded to one of their signature Willard rooms which are a lot bigger than the normal rooms. Our room had a large marble bathroom with separate sink and shower. The bedroom had a large King sized bed and next to it was a sofa and a small seating area. We did not really have a view but that did not matter to us.At that time WiFi internet was not free of charge and it was a bit on the expensive side. The chief concierge was extremely kind and helped us planning our short holiday to the point.Overall a great hotel with superb location, concierge and staff.

Beautiful location and vintage hotel. Great service for our meetings and banquet. Food was nice, check in experience as well. This is an older hotel, and rooms vary in size and layout. I was in a corner room, which had a very small vanity area, too small for getting made up, hair, etc. Request a room with the larger vanity if you have the need for that. My friends room had a much larger vanity area, better space. Bathrooms are all marble, pretty clean for the most part. There was a bit of mold on the shower ceiling and in some of the grout, could us a touch up. Toilets were clean but older, sometimes difficult flushing. Bed and pillows very comfortable. The only concern I had was the very dirty air vent right above my bed. You can see in the picture it appears to not have been cleaned or painted for years, right over my head, a bit if an eye sore, and a bit concerning of what was blowing out of it! When I checked in, the air conditioning in my room was not working correctly, but it was quickly fixed with a phone call to the front desk. There was also a mini bar charge on my room bill which I did not use. The front desk very quickly removed the charge from my bill, without question. Concierge service was very good, quite helpful! Enjoyed the out door dining, patio, and people watching. All in all a beautiful hotel, a good experience, just could use a few tweaks to make it perfect!"

Steeped richly in history and famous guests and decorated beautifully. For me this hotel misses nothing. This service is always perfect and our rooms immaculate. Don't forget to visit the Round Robin Bar for a cocktail. They claim they were the first to invent the Mint Julep. I'm not a fan but had a fantastic Cosmo. This hotel is in a great location for visiting tourist sights such as the smithsonian museums, the mall and many of the monuments."

First impressions are stunning with the lobby & public spaces just wonderfully old-worldly. The front desk retains the multiple key slot shelf that is so reminiscent of all those hotel scenes in 1950s movies. We found that the staff seem to de determined to make you feel special as we experienced friendly, attentive service from check-in to porters & restaurant experiences.Our room was a twin queen with entry vestibule including mini bar and felt spacious compared to our modern New York hotel & the bathroom was also very comfortable. Although only on the 3rd floor, our room faced onto a courtyard section between the next building & we could not hear any traffic noise. The somewhat tired looking flat panel TV was actually replaced by a gorgeous 50-inch screen the day after we arrived but – sadly – only analog channels were available but we were not in DC to watch in-room movies.The Café du Parc was a major asset as this provided a casual dining setting with a (very wide) sidewalk setting reminiscent of European hotels and great food as well. For a more intimate bar experience, the Round Robin certainly lived up to our expectations of rubbing shoulders with Washington insiders (well, we assume they were staffers as the White House is literally a 7 minute walk away).Just one gripe – the pay-to-use internet menu is not in keeping with the general standard of this establishment. The basic option was about $9 for 512kbyte (yep – that’s a k, not an m). The “premium” package was a 24hr, 5mbyte limit for about $14, as I recall). My anti-virus software auto-downloads daily updates & these are typically 2-3 mbyte & the 2nd day I used the internet, Windows wanted to install 127mbyte of “important” updates which I had to cancel. C’mon Willard – this is an amazing property in all other aspects – why limit guests to absurd internet plans such as these?Finally, for a splurge dinner, the Occidental Restaurant adjacent to the hotel (couldn’t quite figure out how this establishment was affiliated with the Willard but who cares) served us truly excellent steak & duck mains with accompanying charming and efficient service.Fabulous experience in this spectacular city."

When we arrived at our room after check-in, we were greeted with a chilled bottle of white wine and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries. I couldn't have arranged a better arrival! It set the mood perfectly. The next day after we came back from our activities, we were greeted by a chilled bottle of sparkling wine! The room itself was beautiful and accommodating. There was a small leak in the bathroom but the hotel staff fixed it promptly after we notified them of the issue. The entire staff was extremely professional and courteous. Upon our arrival, the host behind the desk provided us with a map of the city and circled all the important sites to see and the order in which we should do them.In addition to this hotel being first class in all ways, it was also really cool to see the ""mini-museum"" in the back of the hotel that shows historic stories and artifacts detailing how much history was in this hotel. I would highly recommend checking that out even if you don't stay here.Bottom line, the next time we come back to DC we will strongly consider staying here again."

The room was so magnificent that it made it hard to leave for the concert at The Hamilton next door. The bathroom had a soaking tub with a circular window that looked directly out on the Washington Monument, as if the building was built around that view. The special touch amenities were noticed too -- slippers tucked inside the guest robe, loofah sponges, Scope mouth wash. The service was impeccable, from the front desk, bell hop and concierge. The location for this hotel is also just a short walk to the Smithsonian museums and the south lawn of the White House is literally next door. We even got to Marine One come in for a landing!

The historical aspects are fun to read about in the museum as many presidents, dignitaries and celebrities have stayed in the Willard. The hotel lobby is magnificent adorned with giant columns and architectural details complimenting the marble flooring, paintings and sculptures. A very nice sitting area allows you to enjoy a glass of wine and complimentary snacks while waiting on the valet or retrieving valuables from the safe. We stayed in an upper level suite which was very nice although not quite as big as expected but beautiful nonetheless! The layout of the room was very interesting wrapping around in a ""U"" shape from the entrance & bath, through a short hallway and into the master suite. The staff was aware our anniversary and upon arriving to our room the first evening we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us...very nice touch indeed!We had a very nice view overlooking DC including the Lincoln Memorial in the distance. It was great to be next door to the White House and so many places to visit easily within walking distance. Surprisingly one thing missing is a pool or Jacuzzi here. We had dinner reservations nearby while attending Ford Theatre and the Kennedy Center so we never had the opportunity to eat at The Willard but will be visiting again soon."

The hotel was quiet and we had a good rest after flying in from London. While the furnishings and decor (in our rooms) felt a bet dated, everything was clean and comfortable. My husband chose this hotel for location and it was indeed perfect for sightseeing - the White House, the Washington monuments, mall, and a short taxi ride to the Kennedy Centre for an evening performance. We also enjoyed cocktails outside on the patio, with bright blue umbrellas for shade. The elevators broke down while we were there, so there was a long walk to a different wing for another set. But they were fixed within one day, so it was a temporary inconvenience. The breakfast buffet food in the cafe was excellent, including healthy choices, and the service attentive. We would happily stay here again.Stayed in the Oval Suite on 14th floor. Loved the views of the Washington Monument and the Capital so much cancelled our 4 reservations out and ordered room service - speaking of, it was delivered in less than 1/2 hour during peak meal times and was 5 star delicious. Honor bar is packed full of goodies for snack and drinks to wet the appetite. Taxis stay right across the street to take guest to their destination no waiting. Elevators zip up and down - husband has claustrophobia, but no problem in their elevators. This grand hotel is OPULENT!!! Concierge, bellhops, front desk are all there to do whatever is needed to make your stay in DC a wonderful one. And the city is so clean, not a cigarette but anywhere. Beautiful landscaping, no graffiti and the marble looks brand new, not old and grungy such as Philly which looks like it needs to be power washed city wide."

Historic. Great location. Lobby that's jaw dropping. The elegance continues in the room and ours had a view of the Washington Monument. Unfortunately it also had a view of a building across the square that was having work done on it until 5am which included a constant warning beeps of the crane in action. It wasn't the Willard's fault and they did everything they could to stop the work and even sent me earplugs. However, the sound was exactly the same as an alarm clock, so I spent two nights with absolutely no sleep. The experience was so bad that I just can't bring myself to give the hotel 5 stars, even though it deserves it. Make sure you take a few minutes to have a look at the hotel's excellent little museum. Go to the Cafe du Parc for good coffee and the Occidental Bar and Grill for dinner (expensive but some of the best food I've ever had)."

The room did have the great big window covering almost the entire outside wall instead of the standard window and the view was great so really can't complain too much! We did have afternoon tea one day, was great as usual, although not held in peacock alley as I had had many times in the past. Perhaps that is only on the weekends?

The customer service is amazing. Our room was upgraded for free - we initially had a reservation for the King Executive Suite with a view, and they upgraded us to something better. I'm not sure the type of room, but we stayed in the Martin Luther King Jr Suite 310. It was gigantic. Like 1500 square feet I think. We stayed 5 nights in April 2013. We ordered a room service breakfast every morning, and also had one room service dinner. The food was outstanding, and the service was impeccable. The front desk were extremely helpful and everything we needed was provided immediately and with a smile. The view was OK. We were on the third floor facing Penn Ave, so you really can't see much of the Wash Monument from there if you're on the third floor. But we could see all the way to the Post Office Pavilion on the left to the Wash Monument in the center and the guy on the horse (Sherman? not sure) on Penn Ave on the right. When you stand in front of the Willard you have a beautiful view of the Capitol. A higher floor may have been better for the view of the Washinton Monument, since it was mostly behind another building (Dept of Commerce?). But we enjoyed watching the people on Penn Ave. The room was so breathtakingly luxurious we really didn't need to look outside. And seriously we saw more than enough of the Wash Monument every day while we were out and about. We were surprised we had to pay for Wi-Fi, but it wasn't a big deal to us. We assumed it would be free, but it was not. The room service was great. I had an omelet one morning, and then the other mornings had the classic Willard breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon. Husband had eggs benedict most mornings, and the breakfast sandwich one morning. Breakfasts were amazing. For our one room service dinner, I had the filet mignon, and husband had shrimp spaghetti. I've had better filets (it was a bit fatty), but you can't beat having a luxurious dinner in your hotel room in a bathrobe. I really loved our time at the Willard and we absolutely recommend it to everyone. We will definitely stay there again next time we are back in DC. The location is perfect. We walked everywhere over our 5 days - down to the Tidal Basin on 3 separate days, around the White House one day, and to the museums a couple times. You can definitely walk to the Capitol easily, but we were so tired by then, we took a taxi to the Capitol and then walked back. You can hear traffic noise from the third floor, but we didn't mind it. We enjoyed feeling like we were in the middle of the activity. But being from Minnesota, we weren't used to hearing so much honking and sirens! It seems to only be during the day though. Nighttime was quiet and peaceful. Oh also on the subject of noise, the guests there are so quiet and well-behaved. Our room was right next to the elevator, and I was worried we would hear beeping and people talking, but we didn't. The only time we ever heard any other guests in the hallway was around mid-day when a nearby family would be passing through with their kids. We never heard any elevator beeping. The customer service reminds me of shopping at Nordstrom - just amazingly gracious customer service. They go above and beyond to make sure the guests are happy. There was about a 30-45 minute delay on us being able to check in, and the staff did so many wonderful things for us trying to make up for it. They bought us drinks at the bar, sent up some wine and a fruit basket later to our room, and the manager offered again to take us out for drinks. They really won us over by their amazing service. I can't think of anything else to say, but long story short, we had a wonderful time at the Willard. They exceeded our expectations on every level, and every employee, from the bartender to the room staff to the waitstaff and front desk...everyone...was wonderfully courteous and gracious. Thank you Willard, we will be back."

Check-in was smooth and helpful, as well as quick. As a Priority Rewards member we received an upgrade to a larger room on one of the higher floors. Our room was beautiful, as is the hotel. Service was exceptional and the staff was helpful and friendly.

This will be my number one pick for trips into the city because the location was amazing - only two blocks from The White House!The only issue is transportation to and from airports. If you are flying in and out of Reagan or maybe Dulles then the taxi fare probably is okay, and worth it. The Metro would work if you don't mind dragging your luggage to the Metro stop - but that can be a big hassle sometimes. Taxi to BWI is like $70, so beware."

This hotel is worth every penny.Stayed at the Willard over Christmas 2012, arrived Christmas eve and departed the day after Christmas. It was great staying at a hotel that has so much of America's history attached to it, and to think it lay in disrepair before IHG resurrected it. Room was beautiful, with a view of the Washington monument. It was great being a 5 minute walk from the White House, which made it great for viewing the National x-mas tree and all the state trees.The room wa very clean and well-maintained, did not use items in the refrigerator as did not to pay for the stocked items.Christmas brunch was astounding, delicious, with the most amazing wait service ever!"

My wife and I had the most wonderful New Years eve 2012 stay ate the Willard. As a native Washingtonian I had never stayed at the Willard and boy was it a treat. Before we arrived, the staff, especially the reservation staff, the front desk staff (Ali and Sama) were outstanding. The front desk manager graciously upgraded our room to a wonderful suite with a memorable view of the monuments. My wife and I have stayed all over the world, but the Intercontinental Willard really was the most luxurious and delightfully fun hotel we have ever stayed in. The room, linnen, and bath suite were outstanding and a pleasure to use. holiday decorations in the lobby are as famous as the Round Robin bar. We met the nicest other couples both in the Round Robin bar and at Cafe du Parc at dinner. New Years 2013 is already penciled in for us in Washington at the Willard. KUDOs to the staff and manager.Excellent experience was marred by bummer afternoon tea. Like everything at this hotel, the tea is pricey - $94 for two of us. The tea comes in a small (two cup size) pot. I finished my pot when only halfway through the food. My last cup was very bitter, and I asked for another pot of tea. I was told I could have more hot water, but would be charged extra for another pot since there were still tea leaves left. I received about one more cup of water, and 15 minutes later it was still weak and flavorless. I talked to the hostess and received a fresh pot, but with a little lecture about ""usual procedures"". I can see charging for more of the skimpy sandwiches or stale desserts left over from Christmas, but it's TEA...how cheap to skimp on the tea. The atmosphere was lovely, as with every part of the hotel, but save your money for something better than the Afternoon (rationed) Tea. By the way, when we mentioned this disappointment at checkout, an adjustment was made on our bill by the uniformly outstanding front desk staff. We chose this hotel for several reasons: First, because our last two Christmases were very sad and we wanted the ""Christmasiest"" place possible. The Willard certainly met the bill there... Lovely and lavish decorations, Santa in the lobby on Christmas Day, a completely over-the-top Christmas brunch, a stocking on the room door (with cookies, nutcracker ornament, Christmas cracker, etc. Very cute...) 6 stars for holiday cheer! Second, because of location. Couldn't ask for better - read some reviews saying this is an office area that shuts down at night, but found plenty of restaurants and bars roaring with business, walking distance to almost all the main attractions. Third, for our first visit to DC, we wanted to stay somewhere distinctive, not the same chain decor we can find everywhere else. Saw loads of folks bringing out of towners into the hotel, just for the history. We reserved a Willard Room based on tips that they are all excellent corner rooms with great views. Not so....I had envisioned a postcard view, not a courtyard view, so we were offered an Executive suite for a very reasonable additional charge per night. Wow! Corner room with views of the Washington Monument, Ellipse and Nat'l Christmas tree, Lincoln Memorial, WW II memorial, all the way to Arlington. Two rooms, two baths, lovely period reproduction furniture, classic wallpaper and classy framed local scenes on wall...absolutely the way to go if you can. (Didn't see the oval suites, but imagine they would be faint-worthy) Service by bellmen, doormen, front desk, concierge, Cafe du Parc staff, was perfect - again 6 stars. They actually seemed to want to make the guests happy. Housekeeping, not so much - very spotty and inconsistent. Some days decorative bed pillows were left on the floor where we put them, some days back on the bed. Some days toiletries were replaced, some days not. Had to beg for more coffee and tea (controlled by the Afternoon tea people perhaps???) The phones have an ""Anything"" button - and were always greeted by name when the phone was answered. Package including breakfast was an outstanding value - enjoyed Cafe du Parc food and service very much. Despite the minor ""cons"" we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others."

Lovely rooms, good service, an in house Elizabeth Arden Spa. You feel very pampered staying here. Also near The Old Ebbitt Grill which is a historic place to eat with good food."

Its an older classy hotel, and nicer than any of the other Intercontinental Hotels Ive been to. Most of the others seem to be 3-4 star hotels that are a bit worn. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the Intercontinental/IHG Hotel chain (which includes Holiday Inn), but this is a very nice place. I usually prefer startwood hotels like the W next door, but the wedding party was staying here.The rooms are quiet, clean, and comfortable. The service was attentive and very good overall. I didnt spend much time using the hotel facilities. If you are getting a good rate, this is a great place to stay, albeit it may be a bit expensive."

The hotel is gorgeous with incredible luxury and detail from the courteous staff to the immaculately maintained property and rooms. We stayed in a deluxe King Room on the 6th floor overlooking 14th Street. It was not as noisy as other reviews have stated but I live in NYC have a higher tolerance for street noise. The room was immaculately clean and HUGE. Bathroom was a nice size with great toiletries. Located a block from the White House and in the center of the city this hotel is a great find. I hope to return to the Willard in the near future.When I was booking this trip to DC we didn't rent a car we planned on walking. What a great choice. The Willard is situated so that you can walk out the front door and within minutes be on the Mall walk to the White House see the Smithonians. Wear comfortable shoes because the mall is 2 miles long but the walk is beautiful. You will be seeing historical buildings and walking through a really beautiful city. Our room was on the 12th floor with a very large round window that looked right at the Washington Monument we could not have been more pleased.We had a two room king suite our bedroom was sunken and had a flat screen TV with a writing desk and nice comfy chair. The sitting area and bathroom were up four steps and had another flat screen TV with a small sofa and several chairs. The bathrooms are a little small. This is a very old historical hotel so the tub and shower are together but it has been well renovated and it was extremely clean. there was also a small minibar with small frig and coffee maker closet and safe. We had room service several times.... it was fantastic and its also 24 hr which my husband loved. If you are going to DC to see the sights you really cant go wrong with the Willard. Great food awsome location and nice luxury accomodations. We had some service issues with a light bulb and fuse blowing out in the bathroom. they fixed it within minutes

First time trip to Washington and the US. We received a warm welcoming from both the porters and front desk staff. The foyer is magnificent. The room was very tidy and large. The room faced the main street next to the hotel, which made the night time very loud. I was suprised it was more loud here that in The Chatwal in NY, which is just off Times Square.The bathroom was average, but very clean and tidy. The front desk staff were very helpful in advising on the touristy places and where to find a good meal.The location (in terms of sights) is excellent. Just 5mins walk from The White House and only a little further to The Mall.Would stay here again.My husband and I stayed here while we visited Washington D.C to see a Yankee/National game. This hotel is very historic looking. Our room was a little small, but expected for an old hotel in the city. We took the subway to the game which was only a few blocks away, cheap and let you off right at the stadium.I notified the hotel ahead of time that it was my birthday and they sent up a cupcake with a candle. (This is probably because I am a platinum priority club member)The Willard is only a couple of block away from the White House and Washington Monument.My only disappointment when was when I left there was a $12 charge on my account. The lady at the front desk told me it was for the internet I used. My husband access the internet from his iphone! That's a little pricey!"

It is said that this is where the term ""lobbyist"" began when people seeking to influence government would hang out in the ""lobby"". A plaque outside commemorates the hotel as the site of a pre-Civil War meeting hoping to resolve North and South differences before shots were fired.A. (I won't use real names) at the front desk was exceptionally helpful not only during my check-in but during my entire brief stay. K. was another exceptional employee I encountered several times and who was always helpful and courteous. The room had sufficient space, actually larger than I expected by Washington DC standards. (I believe it was called a ""King Deluxe"".) It was very clean and functional in every way.The restaurant was outstanding! Pricey, but very good, with excellent service. We also had one dinner at Occidental Grill which is adjoining and somehow related to the Willard Group--outstanding with great service. Pricey too. Maybe it is better for couples than tourist families.The White House is a very short stroll from the Willard. However, this neighorhood is not vibrant at night. You might want to consider Dupont Circle or Penn Quarter areas, as examples, even though both are a short taxi ride from the Willard.The Willard - a great property with historical significance."

Simply put, it is perhaps the most elegant, well-appointed, and sophisticated hotel I have ever stayed in. We loved it, although we only stayed one night.The hotel was super easy to get to even though we didn't have a car. It's within a few blocks of at least two Metro stations (Metro Center & McPherson), and sits in an upscale part of the city that's walkable and safe.Michael - the FD clerk from Austraila - warmly greeted us at check-in and gave us what appeared to be a corner room, so kudos to him for giving us what seemed to have been a room upgrade!Room service was fantastic and delivered on time, well within the timeframe promised when our order was put in.The water pressure in the bathroom faucets are a bit tame, and the toilet had a bit of a weak flush, but I'm guessing those are natural resource saving measures, which makes me admire the hotel even more.I came to the hotel happy about my free night, and left even happier after the awesome stay, and am sure to be again!"

Positives:+ Location- in a lovely part of town, very close to White House & your bus stops outside.+ Elegant rooms, with the usual IC beds and housekeeping standards.+ The Round Robin bar is an elegant & refined place to have pre-dinner cocktails.+ The public areas of the property are beautiful and well maintained.+ Received good Royal Ambassador treatment, although we had to ask to have Internet removed from the bill.+ L'Occidental was superb. They do an excellent steak!Negatives:- The water wasn't always hot in the room- The service at breakfast & generally in Cafe du Parc was hit/miss. The staff quite often kept you waiting for long periods of time.- Upon check out, we had to wait about 25 minutes for bags to be brought down & put in to taxi. Inexplicable delay.- Upon arrival at about 4pm, our rooms weren't ready & we were not offered a holding room, as we should have been.Verdict: I love this hotel! Well situated, elegant rooms & plenty of period charm. The slightly hit/miss service failings prevented me from rating this hotel as ""excellent"".I stayed at the Willard for one night whilst visiting friends in the DC area. It is a very impressive property in terms of it's interior (the lobby will floor you) and exterior. I have stayed in other hotels close by, such as the JW Marriott, but this has been my favorite and I would return again. I rated it 'very good' instead of 'excellent' because I have stayed in other properties around the world that are more luxurious, with slightly better service and more modern facilities. Some more detailed points: Room - I stayed in 1130, which was HUGE. The furniture was in good condition and everything was clean. However, the bathroom did look slightly dated and was small (in general, it was not as grandiose as the room and the rest of the property). Food - I ordered a snack from room service and the food was pretty good. It also arrived quite quickly. Drinks and snacks at the Round Robin Bar were of a high standard. Location - Excellent, excellent location...hands down. You can't get better then this as your right in the centre of everything (restaurants, tourist sites, the White House, etc.). I rented a car and drove in from Dulles, which was very easy and took about 30-40 min.Service - The staff were polite and what I expected from a hotel of this caliber (almost five stars, but not quite)."

When my power got knocked out by major thunderstorms and wasn't scheduled to return for a week, I caved and decided to call The Willard. They ended up having availability and I jumped on it. Our first two nights in the hotel we stayed in the John Adams Suite which if I'm not mistaken is either te presidential or bridal suite of the hotel. It was a beautiful decadent room except for when taking a jacuzzi bath. Years of grime and mold shot out at me. It was disgusting. I was green sick after seeing it and I don't think it's a sight I will ever recover from. Here I was in the largest most luxuriest suite in the hotel an it was obvious it hadn't been cleaned or used in quite sometime. It was disappointing. My last night I switched to a smaller king room overlong looking 14th street and te national press club, it was very nice and when I felt my sheets weren't quite so fresh the hotel desk sent someone to change and remake my bed. Staying at the Willard is a joy, until you see the bill. I am more than happy to pay for the things I used, purchased, rented and so on. But paying for them multiple times is not my favorite thing. When I went through my bill at the front desk the gentleman said when it wasn't right he would fix it, he just changed the bill to list the charges once and did not change the final price and when I said this doesn't add up it's several hundred dollars too much he looked at me skeptically and proceeded to add it up on his computer. I was right so he got the desk manager to fix and all he did was act dismissively and tell me to call the Intercontinental hotel group HQ line after paying and checking out. I paid and left fuming. Then when retrieving my car I fought for ten minutes with someone trying to prove I owned the car that I had just packed with all my luggage. They didn't have the right ticket number on it. They finally gave me my keys it was embarassing standing on Pennsylvania ave in the heat yelling for him to give me my keys. I just wanted to leave. At the Willard they charge you for every little detail and the hotel staff is so arrogant and rude. I just wish they had given me a little more respect and courtesy. I hat spending so much money and being treated like an ingreat. They really need to rethink how they treat their guests."

From the moment you walk into the hotel’s lobby to the moment you leave there isn’t much about this hotel you can fault. The two standard outs for me were the hotel’s location, right on Pennsylvania Avenue and particularly next door to the White House; and breakfast, all class but delivered in relaxed and pleasant surrounds. The hotel is famous for its ‘mint julep’ cocktails. You must try one. They might be to your taste, they certainly weren’t to mine, but well worth trying as you to settle into the history of the place. I am sure there are many more flash hotels in Washington DC but for this Aussie this place did me just fine."

It was my first time to stay in a hotel of such level, though I travel often for business and usually stay in very good hotels. But this one was something special (and probably, the most expensive place my company ever booked for my business trips :) ).Maybe more experienced premium class travellers could find some flaws in this hotel but I really cannot remeber any noticeable negatives in the quality, facilities and service. I was amazed with the luxury, class, and the whole atmosphere of this (probably the best) hotel in Washington DC!Fantasic lobby with magnificent interior decoration! Imposing, spacious rooms decorated with style and taste, marble bathroom with all the things you'd possibly need. The interior is noway overcrowded with unnesessarily details such as heavy guilding or massive carving, but the outstanding luxury was in everything!I would mention particularly the bed as it was something special. It was the first time in my life when I was every day literally looking forward to getting back to my hotel bed a.s.a.p.! That was the heavenly sleep! 20 of 10!Still there was a couple of things I would probably mention as ""minuses"", One is that the internet connection was charged $10 per day. Seriously, with this room rate it should be definitely free. I also kept a manicure set provided in the room as a souvenir (for some $25 or 30 fee), but the quality was really poor. Again, I mentioned these only for accuracy: these minor details couldn't spoil the overall fantastic impression of this hotel.Breakfasts were very nice with a great choice. The price was high but I assume it is expected in such kind of properties.During our business conference everything was convenient and effective. The business lunch deserves an essay to be written about. Pure L-U-X-U-R-Y! By far the best buffet choice I have seen! Enormous variety of dishes, including lobsters, oysters and finest meats and pates - I had no chance to try even 25% of what was there.We also had a black tie dinner which was served in a chamber with posh decoration and also great quality of food.I think that for those who are ready to pay for oustanding class and quality, this hotel is the right choice.Stayed at the Williard a couple of times during the Summer season of 2011. It is one of the Intercontinental hotels that do not honor the suite upgrade policy of the Royal Ambassador program; they did not even bother to try to find a room with a view of the Washington Monument at my request. Fortunately, the free minibar program privileges were still intact. The bathrooms in the rooms are spacious and I like the white hue of the stone cladding in the bathrooms. The first time I stayed there, there was a dirty wet wash cloth sitting on the side of the bathtub. The following time I stayed, the desk surface was unnaturally sticky. And on the first night of each stay, holes in the linens were spotted on prominently visible parts of the bedding – this was particular shocking, as it was not a lone incident and this hotel supposedly keeps to very high standards. We also experienced reception problem with the television stations and in-room pay movies on each stay – which was annoying. The location is convenient and the building beautiful, but this Summer, I would probably give the hotels on either side of the Williard (JW Marriott or the W Hotel) a try for comparison."

First, if you want a hotel that is a block from the White House, this is one of only a few choices, and by far the classiest. We stayed in one of the ""Willard Rooms"" - larger than average rooms with two queen beds. This was the reason for our choice. These rooms are 532 sq. ft, versus about 250-270 sq. ft. for nearby but cheaper hotels.The lobby, the staff, the amenities -- everything was really first-rate here.My one complaint was that the breakfast at the Cafe du Parc was only fair, and very expensive. I had thought I'd booked the ""with breakfast"" rate, but had not (my mistake), and breakfast for four (two children) was $80-$100 each day. The waitstaff is expert at upselling: ""Would you like some fresh fruit with that, sir?"" This ends up adding substantially to the bill. And, of course, we spent more on 3 hours of babysitting for our grown-up dinner out than we did for dinner and a top-notch restaurant! The babysitter herself, of course, did not see much of that.I would probably not take my kids there again -- it was somewhat wasted on them, but it is a glorious location and very impressive."

Grant - “Those damn lobbyists.”,"This hotel is smack dab in the middle of it all. 2/10 of a mile from the White House, and 8/10 a mile from the Capitol. Too bad the ""occupiers"" feel the need to take over the public property known as Freedom Plaza, right in front if the hotel- but that is not the hotel's fault. I choose this hotel for the location. I was coming to DC to meet a friend, just staying one night for a Red Sox game at nationals Park (last spring training game of the year).They do not have a hotel shuttle, but it cost $1.85 to use the Metro, which went right from Reagan Airport to one block from the hotel. Could not have been easier. I used 40,000 priority club points to stay here. I have to be honest, I would not have spent $400 for this hotel, but I can see why many would. The hotel is beautiful and full of charm and history. The staff was wonderful (they don't treat you lesser than a ""paying"" customer for using points for the stay). I am very glad I decided to use my points to stay here. The room was very nice, (it was their ""basic"" room) and the beds were literally the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on. The ""wet bar"" was a riot- I took a photo but I didn't touch anything! If anything were removed for more than 20 seconds, you'd be charged for it, lol. It had a weight sensor built in to know.The bathroom was large but a little plainer than I thought it would be. Of course there would be a charge for internet use (I find the more expensive the hotel, the more they nickel and dime you) but I didn't bring my laptop for a 2 day jaunt anyway. I would def recommend this hotel if you are using points, or if money is not an issue. It is what it is, and I am just too thrifty to spend $400+ for a night at ANY hotel, but as I said- I know there are plenty of people out there who do, and if I were one of those people. I would say this hotel is worthy of their prices. (I would have LOVED to see one of the suites!)I wanted to check out the Round Robin bar, but it was a sober trip for me (my friend does not drink). DC is a beautiful city, esp this time of year. The people are friendly, for the most part. I hope to return soon so I can see more of it. I am checking off 5 stars for value, because I do feel this hotel was a good use of 40,000 points.Spacy and beautifully furnished hotel. Staff is very polite. simply excellent and a 2min walk to the White House."

Everything we needed was brought swiftly and there was always a follow up call to make sure we received everything. The only negative that I can point out is that although it is ""wheel-chair accessible"" it is not an easy feat. We had a stroller that we had to carry up several flights of stairs just to get to the lobby restrooms. We asked if there was any other way to get up there and we were told ""no"". Not a big deal to us but it would be a bit harder for those with a wheelchair. The location does not get any better. A short walk to restaurants, the metro (about 5-8 minutes), and to most of the main attractions. Not to mention, the hotel is beautifully decorated. Overall, the best hotel we have ever stayed at!"

The decor throughout is opulent but tasteful, and mostly in good state of repair. The bar is a little cramped, but at least they know how to serve Hendricks gin! Conference rooms still suffer from poor lighting in some rooms and binary air conditioning in others. Once again though! I will complain bitterley about being charged over $10 per day per device for wifi on top of a very expensive room rate ( hence the poor rating on value)."

Tea time was nothing special. The staff walked through the peacock alley area carrying clothes hangers on both arms and other items that looked like table cloths draped over their arms. So much for the tea atmosphere. I will not recommend this place to anyone."

While it has an array of room types and rates, if you are checking TripAdvisor, you are probably like us, looking to stay very comfortably but at an affordable cost. We stayed two nights, first night was at a pre-paid weekend rate of $249. Second night was an Amex special package rate of $379 that offered $100 general food&beverage credit + $40 Breakfast credit. Do the math and you will find it's pretty reasonable for this top-end hotel.The room was very large and very comfortable. We were on 10th floor. Room was super quiet. Recently renovated, the room and bath were completely up to date.The lobby area is extensive with many comfortable places to sit or stroll around. be sure to find the small history room, it's quite interesting.Cafe du Parc offers an extensive and high quality breakfast buffet. It was a bit busy, but we were not at all rushed. Weather was pleasant so we sat outside in the courtyard. The Round Robin Bar is very historic and worth visiting, but it s very small and very crowded - you may not find space to sit in the bar itself. Occidental Grill has mixed reviews online but we were not disappointed. But it is expensive, so be prepared. Also, be sure to ask the price of the specials. They will gladly rattle off some wonderful sounding items but neglect to mention that the filet and crab entre is $55 all by itself.Our ONLY negative comment was that the $100 food & beverage credit did not apply to the Occidental Grill, and we were not informed of this ahead of time. SO BEWARE! The Grill is advertised everywhere in the hotel, website, elevators and rooms, and you can charge your dinner to your room. Yet when we tried to apply our $100 credit, we were informed post-facto that the restaurant is actually ""off property"" and our credit did not apply. Very uncool as there is absolutely no indication that this is the case. My only other pet peeve is the absurd charges for wireless internet access at luxury hotels; it is unnecessary gouging. And don't get sticker shock at $48/night parking. Remember, it's all about the location.All in all, a well informed traveler can enjoy a top quality stay here. I highly recommend becoming informed, planning properly and enjoying the historic luxury the Willard has to offer."

It's easy to go to the hotel from there by taking metro. Three stations away, it's Metro Center Station. The hotel is easy to find and it's just two blocks from a metro exit. Within 5-minute walking distance, there are a bakery, a CVS Pharmacy and some great restaurants and cafes. The White House is just a turn of the corner! As an overseas tourist, it feels amazing to be staying at a place so close to the politically most powerful man on Earth! I found many homeless people sleeping in the streets but they didn't look like they would create disturbance to tourists. The neighborhood is guarded by the police everywehere because of obvious reason. I felt safe even if I return late at night.The hotel staff I encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. I could see they were doing their best to exceed the standard for a US hotel but it's still nothing like the Asian hospitality from where I come from.Overall, I am very much impressed by this hotel and staying here is already one of the 'things I have done' in my DC experience."

Everything about the hotel was beautiful and we stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms and can only speak to their quality. Very comfy bed and other furnishings. Room walls and door are very substantial as I would barely notice any noise from other hotel guests, which is a big plus imo. The hotel cafe was wonderful for breakfast and lunch. Lots of nearby places to eat as well. Be sure to get a drink on the rooftop bar at the W next door and you can look over the U.S. Treasury and the east wing of the White House."

My husband was attending a conference in D.C. (at The Willard). My mother, sister, two sons and I tagged along for pleasure. My husbands conference was held at The Willard and we rec'd a modest price break. But - not enough of one!The Willard is the oldest and grandest hotel in the D.C. area. It IS beautiful and while most of the staff was very friendly, the price is just astronomical and the service is sub-par. I have never stayed at a hotel with such poor room cleaning service. Also, it is the only hotel I've ever stayed at with a $30/day Wi-Fi charge! This is on top of the average nightly rate of $800!!! There is a Business Center which I used for a brief connection to the internet to print our departing boarding passes. The charge for this was $5/5 minutes!I am an extremely early riser and at 5:30 a.m. at a hotel filled with business clientele, no one could assist me in getting a cup of coffee. Nor did anyone try!I just feel the price of this hotel is very inconsistent with its service!I stay at InterContinental hotels where I possibly can -I have been to their properties in Hong Kong, Sydney, London, Rome, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam...and I have to say that this is one of the best InterContinental hotels that I have had the pleasure of staying in.Briefly:Positives:-Comfortable beds-Locations-Decor and ambiance -the lobby really is stunning and this elegant theme runs throughout the hotel.-Service, with two exceptions below, was pleasant.-Outside bar and restaurant area is very special. You can sit on Pennsylvania avenue with a drink and watch the world go by. It is right in the diplomatic area, so if you are on holiday, you can just sit and stare at the various officials and security personnel who are busily running one of the world's most powerful countries!-Attention to detail: housekeeping left no stone unturned in their cleaning. The rooms, although traditional, were SPOTLESSLY clean and the bed sheets immaculately ironed and placed.-Laundry service -quick and professional. Negatives:-Bell staff are slightly inattentive-Service at breakfast was appalling. It takes an age to receive tea or coffee and then again to receive the bill (check) once asked for.In summary:The staff are friendly and courteous; the rooms are elegant with comfortable beds. The food is absolutely delicious and the concierge attentive."

It is not often that I stand in awe of a hotel lounge, but this one certainly did it for me. The Willard's design is of a period of American might and money that was only seen by the rich and the famous. Just walking into it wisps away any doubt about the cost of a room. The staff were quick to any needs, and had the concierge provided top notch recommendations of how to get around. We were in DC for the July 4th fireworks (a must see at least once) which causes the city to be flooded with droves of people. The hotel is only short walk from the National Mall, which allowed us to quickly return to our rooms once they were over instead of battling the hundreds of thousands of spectators. Keep in mind that they will need to check your key to let you into the building during major events such as July 4th. You will understand when you see the number of people on the streets. Our room was much larger than I even thought it would be. Perhaps I got upgraded and did not notice, but we had more room than some apartments have. I got to see into some of the suites, and they are well worth it if you have the extra money (but a bit too pricey for me). Expect to pay for internet (its an InterContinental... they all charge) and for parking if you bring your car. I recommend just flying into DC and taking the metro or a taxi. Its cheaper, and way more convenient then trying to find parking - then paying a lot for it.The Willard, one of the oldest hotels in Washington DC is a step back in time. We had a lovely suite, all-be-it at the rear. The rooms are enourmous and very comfortably furnished. The two large double beds were fantastically comfortable. I think I particularly liked it for it's very sympathetic restoration. It is not trying to be a modern hotel, but wonderfully old fashioned.The staff are typically American, that being unfailingly helpful and polite. I know that some people find the 'have a nice days' anoying after a while, I, coming from London, find it refreshingly charming.Breakfast is everything you would expect, in the lovely Cafe Du Parc, which for the rest of the day becomes a French bistro.The Round Robin bar if perfect, as is the Occidental Grill (a must visit).I defy any hotel in Washington to have a better location, almost next to the White House, with the Capitol at the end of the street, and all the museums and the Mall just a short walk away."

Nice, historic hotel with elegant common areas but what makes it great is how close it is to everything. A few blocks away from the White House and the National Mall and within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants. The ambiance is really nice inside the hotel as well and the extra amenities in the room like cotton pads, q-tips, nail file and emery board were great. The room itself was a little dated but extremely spacious, which was surprising given some of the reviews we read, and had a big, flat panel TV. The king bed was huge and very soft and comfortable but too soft for my sleeping habit. Housekeeping did a great job of taking care of the room during our 4 night stay. The room was always clean by the time we got back to it in the late afternoon. The room attendant was also very appreciative of the tip we left for her every day and made a point to tell us one day in the hallway. We were surprised she even knew who we were since we only saw her in passing once before she thanked us. We made sure to avoid touching any of the stuff at the mini bar after reading the advice on this site. Although the front desk efficiently took care of some charges from a couple at the desk when we were standing there that had just moved a few items but did not consume them. So even if you do move items from the mini bar it did not seem to be an issue. The concierge service was also very nice to have and very helpful. They were able to suggest a couple of restaurants, help us get out to union station for a tour, and gave us some information on the metro. We had drinks and dessert out at the Café du Parc a few times but did not have a meal there. We were going to have brunch there on Sunday morning but it was $31 per person and that was more than we were willing to pay for brunch. The outdoor patio was great though since the weather was amazing. The only issue we had during our stay was when we went to check out of the hotel. When we checked in we were told it would be ok to pay in cash when we checked out but when we went up to settle our account they had already charged our credit card the day before we checked out. They claimed it was because we booked an “advanced purchase” through the Priority Club website but we had never had this issue before. We always pay in cash when we stay at a hotel upon checkout but this is the first time there was a problem with it. Strange especially since we had talked to the front desk about checking out with cash when we checked into the hotel and they said it wouldn’t be an issue. They were eventually able to credit our account back so we settle in cash. We would definitely stay again because the location of this hotel just can’t be beat."

Fantastic, amazingly historic hotel.","My wife and I stayed at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel for four nights. This was a much needed getaway weekend for both of us. The stay was free as part of my Priority Club membership. We arrived around 11pm on Friday night. I was a bit surprised that there was no bell staff to greet us upon stepping out of the Taxi. No worry for us as we only had carry on bags, but worth noting none the less. The check in staff was cordial and welcoming. They easily combined the two reservations that we had so that we would not have to check in and out after the first night. Shortly after we got to our room we received a call from the front desk telling us that due to some unforeseen major plumbing repairs two nights of our stay would not have water from 11pm - 5am. Wow, okay I asked could they at least upgrade our room. They quickly put us in a very nice 1000 square foot suite on the 12th floor. They sent a bellman up quickly with the new keys. The original room was nicely appointed but on the smallish size. The new room was fabulous. Kitchen area, dining table, sitting area, bed area, tons of closet space. The bathroom though large had a very tiny shower. Functional but tiny. There was a large cast tub in the bathroom. The room was very quiet with no noise from the street below. I did have to put a pillow over the backlit light switches by the nightstand each night. The bed was very comfortable though the pillows left a bit to be desired. We did experience a bit of noise from the plumbing work the second night, but the hotel provided us complimentary breakfast the next three mornings to make up for it which was a nice gesture for about 30 minutes of noise overnight. I do think that they did everything they could to make our stay wonderful. As for the water being out they offered to send up a bellman with water for the toilet if needed, but we just filled our tub as a backup before the water went out. (I know, we are low maintenance!) Housekeeping was always friendly and did a good job of keeping the room fresh. The room had a nice 32” HDTV and plenty of cable channels. There was a nice work desk. The lobby of the Willard is beautiful. Look for the state seals in the ceiling. Be sure to check out the small display room at the back of Peacock Alley….there is a history of the Willard display that was rather neat to look at. Hard to believe this beauty was almost demolished. The concierge staff was always helpful and friendly. I am not able to comment on the workout or spa facilities. We were active during out entire stay so did not need to test these facilities. They do offer a business center with typical charges for a higher end hotel. The concierge printed our boarding passes for us so that we did not have to use the business center. The hotel has 24 hour room service but once again we did not partake of this offering. The absolutely fabulous thing about this hotel – the history of the hotel makes you feel like you are part of DC. Also the location is perfect for tourists. You are less than a block from the White House, .4 miles from the Washington Monument / National Mall, .5 to 1 mile from all the Smithsonian Museums (depending on which one) and 1.1 miles from the Capital / Union Station. All of these are easy to walk to, though the Capital takes about 20 minutes. If you decide to take any of the hop on hop off tour busses, they depart from right in front of the hotel. There are several good dining options within 5-7 minutes walking distance. The one disappointment with the hotel is their restaurant Café du Parc. We probably would not have eaten breakfast here if the hotel had not comped the meals for us, but I am going to review the restaurant as if we were paying. Breakfast entrees range from about $12 - $18. The Buffet is approximately $24 per person. It could be a wonderful buffet, as the selection is great, but the food each day tended to range from under cooked and cold to dried out and tired from the heat lamps. The first and third days were pretty good; the second day was barely edible. (Other than the fruit which was wonderful.) Do yourself a favor, if you are paying for the meal, go to Old Ebbitt Grill for breakfast; it is only a block away. We had one less than stellar waitress for two days, and a very good waiter the last day. The support staff did however take great care of us when the waitress was always absent. All in all I would highly recommend the Willard, guest service is top notch, the rooms are wonderful, and the location is great.Despite a few service blemishes, the hotel is historic, glamorous, the location is perfect and probably the best spot in the city for tourists wanting to visit the monuments and museums along The Mall each day. The public areas are over-the-top, decadently beautiful with custom-loomed carpets, marble pillars, gold moldings, red velvet, etc.Especially given the discounted rate currently available, (about $400/night prepaid on Expedia with buffet breakfast for 2 given as a $50 daily credit) we would absolutely choose this hotel again. Service was blissfully unpretentious. Front desk is efficient and courteous. They did make an error on checkout, did not see my $2,400 prepay. This was (with some difficulty figuring out on their part) corrected when I quesioned it. Bellhops expect tips when luggage brought into the lobby and then again when they bring it to the room. Unlike other 5-star hotels I have been in, bellhops blatantly push for tips. Housekeeping always greeted us and were eager to please.Service is excellent but not impeccable. We did not have a nightly turn-down service, nor was a paper delivered to our room, it was kept in a stack near the elevator. I believe these may be available in a higher room stay level. Restaurant service friendly but again not top drawer (in the breakfast buffet, they take your dirty utensils off your plate and put it back on the table when you go for more food rather than give you a new one for instance). Phone service is excellent, they answer you promptly by name (pronounced correctly!).We had a deluxe room #731 overlooking the courtyard. Room was very large, quiet, fairly clean, and the bathrooms wonderfully clean. Mattresses were good, but not of Westin/Four Seasons quality. Plenty of towels (including wash cloths!) were always provided. However, they never vacuumed under the beds or bureaus...we know this because on our last day, we checked under the beds to make sure we didn't miss anything; there were plenty of large dust balls and a pair of sandals from some previous guests! There were a few minor things not in working order...the tv speaker in the bathrooms was pulled out of the wall, and the clock-radio iPhone plug did not work. The digital tv is amazingly slow turning it on and froze once, but turning it off and back on fixed it.We made almost no use of the concierge, as the recommended DC restaurants are consistent across Fodors, Frommers, Lonely Planet, etc so check these sites online. The Old Ebbitt Grill is one block in back of the hotel, across from the White House, was a great inexpensive place for a meal with decent quality food.Note that the famous restaurant ""The Willard Room"" is now closed, the room is available for business and party rentals only. They have replaced it with a casual french-style ""Cafe du Parc"" on the side of the hotel which was warm and nice, had a nice seating area in front of the hotel during the day. The breakfast buffet ($25) is here, was decent but never varied during the 6 days we were here.The only minor inconvenience that really mattered was the Prime Minister of Iraq, Maliki, was staying in the hotel while we were there. It is a bit inconvenient as extra precautions are taken, more so than with other world leaders. There were secret service men in the lobby, on every floor, the rear street, rear hotel entrance, and rear elevator were blocked for his use. Karzai, the Afghan president also stays at this hotel with similar precautions we were told.All of these minor inconveniences pale in comparison to the perfect location for tourists visiting the main sites along The Mall. The location is a few blocks closer to The Mall than even the Hay Adams. The Marriott was directly across the street, but it did not look like a 5-star hotel.We used our Holiday Inn free nights to stay here for 2 nights in July 2009. I never would have thought we could have used the free nights here but we did. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We rode in on Amtrak and used the Metro to get to the hotel. Parking is available but is Valet only. We arrived early, around 10 am, and we were checked in without question, check-in is stated as 3 pm. Our reservation was for a King Wheel-Chair room, that was all that was available for the free nights promotion. Our room turned out to be a standard double-bed room with a view of the courtyard in the center of the hotel. We could not see any of the DC monuments from our 7th floor room but that was ok, we are not picky. The room was HUGE compared to your average hotel room, we stayed at the Omni Shoreham over by the Zoo before and it was the same... very large and spacious rooms. The room featured a desk with lamp, phone and chair, 2 VERY comfortable double beds, nightstand with phone, lamp and alarm clock that was also an IPOD dock, Flat screen LCD TV but not HD, the TV stand doubled as a dresser, a corner round table and 2 comfortable chairs. There was a well stocked frig and also some food items, we stayed as far away from those as possible, as the prices are a bit crazy. I small coffee pot worked well, we used it to make tea each morning. The closet was large and had a nice size safe to store personal items of value. The bathroom was spacious and very nice. If I had one complaint about the room it would be the shower head. My wife loved it but I thought it was in need of a replacement. The thing put out about a gallon of water per second (alittle exaggeration here) but it was all in the space about the size of my hand. I tried adjusting the little lever but could not get a nice wide spray pattern. I have stayed in much lesser hotels that have the big shower heads, this one just looked out of place in such a nice hotel.We brought our own bottle of Champagne and we asked at check-in if they could hold it for us and bring it up to our room that night, chilled and with some flutes. The front desk called dining and we were not in our room for 2 minutes before some one was at the door to pickup our champagne bottle. 2 minutes later another person showed up, lol. The champagne was supposed to be delivered at 10 pm but we got back from dinner early, so we called dining and they brought it up about 15 minutes later. It was nicely chilled and in a champagne bucket with 2 flutes.We only ordered room service once, it was a spur of the moment thing and our order was brought promptly to our room in about 20 minutes.My wife tried the Red Door Spa, she had one of the cheaper packages and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.High speed internet and wireless internet will run you $10.95 a day. Alittle secret tip... There is an ""Open Park Project"" that provides free wireless Internet access to the public on the National Mall and nearby parks using WiFi. The signal strength from our 7th floor room was between 85% and 95% percent. We had no trouble connecting and using the Free WiFi service.We did not dine at any of the hotels restaurants or bar, so I can not comment on those. There is no lack of places to eat at or near the hotel. For a VERY good and cheap breakfast, try the Corner Bakery Cafe across the street. The Ronald Reagan Building across the street has a very nice food court that has a good selection of foods to eat. The Old Post Office Pavilion has a food court also with some good choices, we went there for the Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and enjoyed some live entertainment that was taking place during the lunch hour.The nearest metro is Metro Center about 2 blocks away. The National Mall is about the same. We walked ALOT but it was great time and we loved it."

As I have Ambassador status with Intercontinental I chose this hotel. I am very glad I did. Upon check-in I received a room upgrade - yest the rooms are a bit tired but who really cares as long as it is clean and the AC works. Location is perfect as you are a 10 minute walk to the Smithsonian, the White House, the Mall, etc etc etc.Price is reasonable as well though my one complaint is after I had booked on line the price was cheaper 50 dollars and the company would not change the price.Also - had Sunday brunch in the adjacent restaurant that was HORRIBLE - I did a review, check it out. The hotel, however is really really good."

This cost us 80,000 points for the two nights. We arrived about 2pm and were able to check-in immediately. I agree with the earlier poster who stated that Priority Club members aren't treated fabulously, but they weren't rude. My husband (being a goof) asked if there were any upgrades available since he's a Platinum member. I don't think I saw the front desk clerk roll his eyes, but I'm sure he wanted to. We were checked into a ""lovely room with a great view"" on the 3rd floor- as assured by the clerk. We were at the end of the hallway, and our ""lovely view"" was a corner room overlooking the roof and looking at the back of other hotels/apartment buildings/I'm not sure what. So much for the ""lovely"" view we were hoping for! The room was a little small, but didn't feel like a closet at all. The bed was fantastic, just like all the other Holiday Inn's we had stayed at along the way of our road trip. This hotel has character, it has history...you pay for those. I didn't know what to expect in the area of the bathroom, since this hotel was so old. (I know, odd question, but I don't stay in old hotels ever.) The shower was great, I just wish there was a bit more sink-top room available for getting ready in the morning. The mini-bar is stocked full of things you shouldn't touch so you don't get charged. The IPod docking station was a nice touch, as we did need that. We used the internet to uphold our photos from our digital camera, it was a bit slow, but we were probably the reason for that. We ordered room service for breakfast, be willing to spend a lot of money for not a lot of food. But the food was very good, as was the hot chocolate. We also ordered room service later in the evening for dessert and it was presented on a lap-table for the bed, which was a nice touch. The concierge was fantastic, room service was prompt, and housekeeping finished our room at a decent time. I would love to stay here again, but am really glad I didn't have to pay for all of it, since we wouldn't have stayed here for the price!We did the sight-seeing Trolley Tour and would highly recommend it. The bus tours use a prerecorded tape for their tours (from what I've heard), whereas the Trolley Tour driver is also your guide. It rained the whole time, but we got some great pictures. We also did the International Spy Museum, a must for a family with kids or a big kid at heart.At check-out...I watched as General Petraeus walked in for a meeting with other heads of state and Jennifer Garner left the building at the same time as we did. Nice touch!"

Once you enter into the lobby you're taken in by the grandeur of the place. We arrived very early on a red-eye from the west coast, but our room was available for us to check in at once. The front desk staff was very professional and check in was very fast. We were assigned an executive suite and it was a fabulous room. There was a very large bedroom with king bed, desk and chair, and a large marble bath attached. Down a short hallway, there was a second full bath, and a combination dining and sitting/TV area. We had drinks at the bar, which I highly recommended. You can imagine the deals being made there. They make great French 75's here.The location can't be beat for sightseeing -- even in the dead of winter, it's walking distance to most everything you'd want to see on a sightseeing trip, and the metro is walking distance too. It can be an expensive place to stay, but for the quality of the service and the location I think it's well worth the price. We will definitely stay here again upon our return to DC.My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to DC for Christmas and had booked us a room with a view in this wonderfully old, amazing hotel. We got there the day after Christmas, so the hotel lobby was still decorated and everything was just gorgeous. Our room, which was on the 7th floor, was comfortable, very clean, and had a great view of the Washington Monument and PA Avenue, with the National Mall, the White House, and the National Christmas Tree just steps away. There's a great little bar on site, but for even more of the DC ""atmosphere"" and some great dining as well, I recommend walking right around the block to Old Ebbit Grill on 15th Street, NW. Expect to be treated well at this hotel, right down to coming back to your room to find the bed turned down, chocolates on the pillow, and the in-room Ipod player/Radio/Clock set to soft, romantic classical music.Not recommended for families with ""very active"" children."

Chose Willard hotel based on its location (almost next door to White House and central to everything) and luxurious details. These two things didn't disappoint us at all. As Ambassador members, we were upgraded to a great view room on the fifth floor. The room was quite ordinary but spacious and overlooked the Mall. We had breakfast in our room every morning. Our table was set up by the window and we enjoyed the view a lot. The food and presentation were good as well. The service, however, was lacking professionalism and was even rude at times. Front desk, belldesk, phone communications. Certainly, not up to the Intercontinental standards. With that said, we enjoyed our stay in Willard immensely. It was a pleasure coming back to our room after all that walking we did in DC. The bed was very comfortable with soft and crispy linens. Would come back there any time. Greatly recommended."

The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays. A harp in the background was playing popular Christmas carols. We were in town to attend a reception. We didn't do any sightseeing but if we had wanted to the location was more than convenient. Staying here, you are a neighbor of the President! It's that close! Upon checking in, we were given a complimentary upgrade and what has got to be one of the best views possible within our price range. Our room, 927, was situated just right so that when we walked in we could see the sun in all its glory make its way down to the horizon. We could also see the National Christmas tree and the Lincoln Memorial. The beds were sumptuous and there were plenty of pillows. Apparently you can request softer or firmer pillows. Our room was very large with a flat screen TV and plenty of options for buying movies. We got ourselves ready and headed to the famous Round Robin bar for a drink before going out. Washington movers and shakers were crowded in like sardines, very animated, such a lively place to be. Drinks were very expensive though. There was a computerized mini-bar in the room. If you take something out for more than 20 seconds you get charged for it. Getting it out of the mini-bar was about the same price as buying it in the bar would have been.The bed turn-down service was a neat surprise! We came back after dinner to find the curtains drawn, chocolates on our pillow and some soothing music playing on the clock / radio. The clock/radio ALSO HAS AN iPOD DOCK!!! So, we could listen to our favorite music and recharge it at the same time.The bathroom was not really special or stylish the way that every other space in the hotel was. But, it was comfortable and functional. The tub is very long, the shower curtain rod is curved for more room. They provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and a shower cap among other things. Also provided are spa robes. We didn't have any trouble with hot water or water pressure. The only problem I could tell was that sometimes we could hear people too well if they were talking right outside our door. But, it never disturbed our rest. The Washington Post is delivered to your door in the morning.On the day that we left, we had a nice relaxed breakfast in the Willard Room. Being in that room and in the other public areas of the WIllard Hotel is like having a time machine. The woodwork details, the tile, the painted ceilings. The breakfast was very expensive as breakfasts go but it was also very good. I don't mind splurging as long as I get excellent food and service. The atmosphere was very elegant. I spent some time in the History Hall upstairs gleaning interesting bits of information on the history of the hotel. It is an accomplishment that this important landmark was restored so beautifully. For too many years it sat vacant and decaying. Only 5% of the original was able to be salvaged--the rest was painstakingly restored. Most of the mosaic tile floors in the lobby are original. The guest rooms were gutted and rearranged to be bigger and brighter. Since the original renovation the rooms have been redecorated as well. The impression I got from the staff is that they understand how special the Willard is. The folks who checked us in were great; we requested and were granted a later check-out which was also greatly appreciated, Everyone was very friendly, polite and helpful. All in all, our stay at the Willard was short but memorable. If you love DC, staying at the historic WIllard will add to your experience. This will not be our last."

The location on Pennsylvania Avenue and views of the Washington Monument were what drew us to this historical hotel.The valet staff are right there ready and waiting to greet you like you are an old friend or frequent customer. Once you walk into the modest lobby you feel like you have been transported back in time to the days of the first Presidents. Marble is everywhere but done in a tasteful manner.Checkout went very smoothly however we had to wait for the Bellman to bring our luggage since our lock was malfunctioning a bit and we could not open the door.When we walked in the room I thought it was elegant but definitely needed updating. We paid extra for the view of the Monument but sacrificed the size of the room for the view. Tad on the small size, to the point of we had to squeeze around the in room dining table for dinner and breakfast. Ahh in room dining...they greet you by name like all higher end hotels should, however they fall flat on the food. We had light sandwiches and salads for a late night snack and both were not memorable in the least. As for breakfast the Filet Mingon (steak & eggs) was dreadful, althought it was tender it was also cold.One more thing, although done in marble the bathroom is older and not impressive. The tub had a hard time draining and the fan as incredibly loud.Would we stay here again? I think so, but only if we got a better deal than $450 a night.I had the opportunity to stay here on business, and the room was paid for by a company. The room price was supposedly $700/night, but the corporate rate was $195. At that price, it is definitely worth the stay.The hotel is beautiful and in a fantastic location. I have visited DC many times in the past, and have always seen the characteristic architecture of this hotel. I always wanted to stay here! The hotel is walking distance to all of the attractions in DC, many metro stops, and great shopping. A Borders and Corner Bakery are across the street and the White House is next door. I got my hair done at the salon around the corner-- Allous, which I highly recommend. The proprietor is very professional.On the weekends, the locals have afternoon tea in the hotel's Peacock Alley. The lobby is a great place to have a (expensive, but good) cocktail and people watch. The word “lobbyist” comes from the lobby of this hotel. I had the Intercontinental cocktail, which was very nice. FYI-- I had cellphone service in this hotel with no problems (my carrier is Sprint). Internet service was a bit expensive.The room was large, with lots of windows. The décor was old world comfort meets modern day amenities. The bathroom was very big, with great lighting, a makeup mirror, great soap, shampoo, body lotion, mouthwash, Q-tips, cottonballs, bathrobe, slippers, etc. The bathroom was very clean. The toilet was so quiet, I didn't realize it flushed. I had a room on the 10th floor, and had a great view of the city. The room had a large TV, but the minibar can be expensive. I had ample closet space, lots of magazines to choose from, and even a dock for my ipod. The maid cleaned my room, and I returned to hear classical music from the radio. It was very relaxing.I ordered room service. The service was quick and very professional. I really enjoyed the salmon.I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in DC. If I could, I would stay here often and every time I visited the city. I had bad back and leg pain as I was traveling, but within two hours of being in the room, I had relaxed so much, I was not in pain. I highly recommend it."

Check in at nine in the evening was fast and helpful. The charming employee recommended tour buses, restaurants, and places to visit, as well as checking the weather for our two-day stay in Washington. Room service was equally fast and rather delicious. The concierge was helpful in giving directions to sights, although his hour-long ""lunch break"" at 6pm made dinner-planning difficult. Our Deluxe Room with two double beds was spacious and comfortable. The housekeeping was excellent, miraculously cleaning our room even if we were out for only a few hours. Turn down service was a nice touch. All staff were very pleasant, friendly, and helpful. Our only caution is that since the Willard caters to the business and political elite, walking around in the hotel in touristy clothes occasionally made us feel a tad awkward. Nevertheless, the Willard's excellent staff and rooms made for a delightful stay. We will certainly return!"

I can tell you that I've had a wonderful experience each time I'm there. In fact, I now alternate between the Willard and the Mayflower for my stays in DC, and consider them my hotels of choice in DC.I've never been ignored or mistreated, including the first time I walked in wearing jeans and sneakers. The staff is so attentive, so discrete and so helpful to all I've seen step through the door. Though I must comment, housekeeping would do better paying more attention to crumbs on room furniture. Otherwise, no complaints at all.The rooms have mostly been HUGE, and the turndown service is complete with just the right kind of relaxing music playing on your radio and a spritz of some kind of citrus in the room. The only thing I'm not fond of are their bath amenities (soaps, lotion, shampoo). I bring and use my own as the ones they provide dry my skin taut. Their towels, bathrobes and slippers are wonderfully plush.The free high speed net service is great for business travelers like myself connecting to work email, and the desks in the room are great for spreading out your work. There's a small business center with most everything you might need on a business trip (fax, paper cutter, printer, copier, computerw/net connection), but I'd not bother with it unless absolutely necessary."

We came with our 3 kids (ages 1, 7, 9) for a 4 night stay during the Cherry Blossom Festival. The first thing that hit us was how elegant the lobby was - I had to take pictures! I noticed that many other people in the lobby were in business attire or elegant casual - being tourists with 3 kids, we definitely were not! Not once were we ever made to feel uncomfortable for being a typical tourist family. On the contrary, the hotel staff bent over backwards for us! Our room was large, beautiful and comfortable, and I loved the orchid in the bathroom.  Particulary wonderful was Concierge Joseph Coston and his staff. These people went WAY above and beyond the call of duty. Our 1 year old baby became very ill the first night we arrived with a high fever and much vomiting, and remained ill the entire stay. He never left the room (with my husband and I playing tag-team sightseeing with the other 2). Joseph and his staff checked on us constantly, and even found a doctor and transportation to the hospital for us. The marvelous housekeeping staff brought a never-ending supply of towels and sheets day and night, and never made us feel like we were an inconvenience. In fact, they learned the baby's name and were very kind to him and us. Knowing this put a damper on the trip for the other 2 kids, Joseph made sure they each got a special gift from him, and always showed an interest in their day.Being confined to the room, we ate breakfast and dinner every day from room service - with the most wonderful menu I've ever seen at a hotel. It was the same fabulous food from the elegant dining room downstairs! (Of course, with the same high prices, but at this point, who cares?) On our last day, Joseph arranged a driver and car for us to do a final trip around the city - a friendly and knowledgeable man with a very clean car.I have to say, this was our best experience EVER in a hotel, and we travel a LOT! I would return there in a heartbeat."

Parking is a little bit of a nightmare due to the location of the hotel being downtown, but my partner managed to find street parking a couple of blocks away. The hotel does offer valet parking, was a little on the expensive side, goes with the location! Upon checking in, staff were friendly, attentive and fast. The room itself large, clean, well appointed and a superb bathroom! Definitely a great base for our Washington stop. Breakfast was included, and had a fabulous array of hot options, customised made to order eggs, as well as a more continental choice available too. The only downside was that the roof top terrace was not open at the time we were having breakfast. We are early risers and the doors from the eating area did not appear to be unlocked until around 8am. Did not stop me from enjoying the area later on in the day. In the hotel itself is a bar that stays open until 22:00, indoor swimming pool and spa and a well appointed fitness area too. I made full use of the facilities whilst I was there. If you do not wish for daily housekeeping, it is a good idea to put the door notification on otherwise your room will be made up and refreshed whether you want it or not. Superb hotel, great staff and a fabulous location to see the sights of the city itself."

We rented out a room at the Hilton Garden Inn for my son’s birthday and used the pool area and had an absolute perfect experience. The event manager Tannia was incredibly helpful along the way and went over and above my expectations to make sure that the party was absolutely perfect, even making Birthday signs for the event. Additionally every time I stopped in to ask a question all the staff were always very helpful. The staff setting up and serving our event were great. The room and facilities were very nice and the food was great for a birthday party. A huge thank you to Tannia and the entire Hilton staff."

The room was lovely, the restaurant on the 2nd floor was nice and guest services were nice as well. I truly loved how warm the room became when I turned on the heat.The beds were so comfortable! The overall decor of the room and hotel was nice. Restaurants next door to the hotel are pretty good as well. So, I like to inspect every hotel I stay in (for bugs, dust etc.). I didn't see any bugs, but I knew there were spiders because of the webs in the corner ceiling. What really made me not give this hotel a 5 star was the amount of dust I found behind the heating vent when I opened it (pictures to follow). If I had bad allergies I would've had a swollen face because the amount of dust that was layered on that filter looked as if it were there from 12 months prior. The vent in the restroom was very dusty and some of the wall paper was coming undone. Before I left I called the front desk to send up the manager and they came and changed the filter immediately. They were very receptive and thanked me for pointing out the issues. I give them a 4 star because I really like the room, but I could do without the dust and webs. Would I go back again? Sure, I would inspect the room again and ensure everything is top notch before settling in."

This hotel is very conveniently located two blocks away from a metro station, NoMa, Gallaudet U station (red line). Hotel provides free wifi and is fast. The staff were all super friendly and helpful. I was able to check in early and was given a nice king size room, which was very spacious and clean. However, the bathroom was very basic. I didn't like that you couldn't control the water pressure and temperature, as the water wasn't warm enough for me. I did liked that Neutrogena toiletries was provided."

It's just around the corner from the hotel. The neighborhood looks recently modernized, and there are many office buildings, restaurants, and shops within walking distance. Plus this side of town is pretty quiet at night, and I slept through the night without waking up. The staff at this hotel is extremely professional, warm, and friendly. When I was checking into the hotel, the customers in front of me were taking a while because they had a lot of questions. I waited patiently and the front desk employee apologized to me that it was taking so long. Then a few minutes later, backup arrived and I was checked in very quickly. He explained the amenities of the hotel and apologized for one of the two elevators being down. I thought that was nice of him to mention that. Also, the room I had preselected online had a previous guest who smoked in the room and it smelled. I'm glad he moved me because I would have complained. One operational elevator takes a while, so a crowd was slowly gathering behind me. Luckily I was on a lower floor so I got off pretty quickly. The elevator lobby was really pretty too!When I got into the room, it was fairly large and had a nice street view. There was a sofa with a coffee table and also a comfortable chair with a side table by the window. The bed was comfortable and had very fluffy pillows. There was also a refrigerator in the room that hummed loudly at night. When I was checking out at 7am, the front desk was very perky and friendly. It took me by surprise! It did get my morning off to a great start. My only complaints about this hotel is that only one elevator was operational, but I understand this is only a temporary situation. The front desk was very proactive about this and it was greatly appreciated. Also the refrigerator running at night can be a bit much. Although it's nothing compared to the traffic I hear all night outside my apartment in New York."

I felt safe around the hotel, but was hassled aggressively by panhandlers asking for money over and over just steps outside the hotel. There is a small grocery store next door which is nice for breakfast and snacks. Don't waste your time in the terrible CVS across the street. During the day, food trucks lined up across the street. Just a few dollar Uber drive or good walk to the Capitol. Few more dollars to get to White House, Lincoln Memorial, etc. FYI - Walking to the Capitol took me fast a...tent neighborhood that was a little creepy at night."

Washroom toiletries are bare minimum. We left almost finished soap bars and shampoo tube in bathroom, and the housekeeping didn't replace these while cleaning. The hotel is near to red line of metro NOMA . Internet is free but very difficult to connect. Rooms have Safety lockers. But this area is not safe and it is developing area with construction projects going on. We were told by our Uber driver and some shop keepers to be careful while going out.

To celebrate my colleague's 40 y/o birthday during July 4th weekend, actually this hotel offered a better deal and location to do the sightseeing than any hotel in Crystal City. To get to the hotel from the Dulles airport, we took the silver line express bus ($5) and metro (silver then red) and it took about 1 hour and 40-50 min. If you are travelling with a group of three or more people, I would suggest that you take Uber to save time (40 min) and money. Our check-in process was painless and the front desk staff was very friendly and professional. We got room 1119 and it was clean and reasonably spacious although there was not much view. Microwave and refrigerator were included in the room. Everything seemed updated and this floor was quiet. The beds were comfortable. Their housekeeping time was given after 3:30 pm (kind of late if you would like to take a nap in the afternoon and still want to have the room be cleaned).Because of my gold membership, we got three complimentary breakfast coupons everyday. My favorite items of the breakfast were fruits- very fresh and delicious, especially for the blueberry. As to the service, their waitresses were friendly, but not attentive enough. During this trip we had two breakfasts with the hotel. For the first one, there was only our group at that time (7:20), but the hostess was hidden in the back area along with two waitresses. For the second one, it was around 8:45, so more customers were in the dining room. The two waitresses had to work harder, but did not refill coffee at all. Some people had to go to the coffee station to get a second cup. The waitresses seemed more interested in collecting used plates than refilling coffee.If this hotel has a good deal again, I will certainly choose it again."

The curb space isn't too great and they go out of their way to try to make the service seamless.If you are staying for any length of time, I highly recommend the King junior suites.

This hotel has both good and bad things, so be sure to read the reviews and research the area before you stay. The area is a tough one that is gentrifying in the area of the hotel - there are modern office buildings around the hotel, but a block away, it's a tough area again. You should NOT plan on walking far from this hotel, get a taxi at the front door to be safe, it's just not worth the risk nor is walking comfortable in the heat and humidity of this city. There is a beautiful, well-stocked Harris Teeter supermarket right next door that stays open late (midnight on weeknights) - you can get hot meals there, and there is a sit down area. The prices in Harris Teeter are better than in the CVS across the street. There is also a Starbucks diagonally across the street. I had room service dinner from The Watershed restaurant in the hotel, and it went down well but it was expensive in more than one way - more about that later. The positive things about this hotel are that it is quiet - I checked in the night before and selected my room online - the even number rooms on the higher floors have a view of the Capitol Building in the distance, and the hotel pool, also a courtyard shared by an apartment building. My room was very quiet, and I appreciated that very much as I don't like noise. The room was clean, and the staff were responsive and polite - in fact, the staff are terrific and very helpful. The TV has HBO (thank you Hilton!), and you have a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room - nicely done. You will need to visit the supermarket next door for milk, water, basics. The toiletries are by Neutrogena, nice. There is a nice desk area with lots of outlets for charging devices. Wifi is free, but is not very fast. Please note that there are ice machines on the even-numbered floors of the hotel only, so if you are on an odd-numbered floor, you will have to travel to get ice. When I ordered room service, I asked for and was promised a bucket of ice, but it did not arrive with the dinner, and the server told me that I would have to go get it myself - please Hilton, get this policy consistent, because no other hotel has ever refused to send a bucket of ice with room service. The negative things about this hotel are that you must use your room key in the elevator to get to your floor, so you must have it available in the elevator. The furniture in the room is NOT comfortable, and in fact, when I arrived, I found that part of the headboard was literally off the wall! Just leaning, and not attached to the wall!I raised this with the front desk, and they fixed it fast, but it was strange to find that, and potentially dangerous. The biggest negatives have to do with the bathroom door - which is very large and heavy, and which hides the switch for the bathroom light when open - why is the bathroom switch outside the bathroom? Very strange. There is a nightlight in the bathroom, which helps. The biggest negative is the bed - it is just not comfortable at all. As others noted, it is a sleep number bed with an adjustable dial, sitting on a platform instead of a boxspring. But the platform is too big for the mattress, so it juts out at the bottom of the bed - and when this is covered by the bedspread, you bump into it. I bumped into the platform again and again, with the result that I had bruises on both legs the next day, not good. Second, the dial for the bed indicates that you can adjust the firmness of the bed - and there are instructions at the front desk about an adjustment needing up to 45 minutes to work. The dial on the bed in my room seemed to be broken (see photoO, and strangely, there was a large gap between the bed and the headboard. I did not adjust the bed at all because it was on least firm setting, so I thought that was OK. But while I slept, the slant on the mattress increased so that I ended up lying at an angle with my head lower than my feet, with the result that my expensive room service dinner came back up, giving me the worst acid reflux of my life! Thankfully, I had Alka Seltzer with me, and that saved me from a trip to the emergency room, such was the pain, but I will never, ever book a room in a hotel with these types of beds again, they just do not work for the comfort of the guests. Without the lovely staff, I would give this hotel a ""poor"" rating, but the staff take it up to average. Another note - the printer in the business center in the second floor was not working, so I could not print my boarding pass for my flight the next day. I would advise the hotel management to replace the beds completely, removing the platforms and the adjustable mattresses to reduce leg injury from the platforms, and to provide customers with a bed that you can actually sleep on and that will not literally give you heartburn! One last thing - when you check out, they tell you that they will email your bill. Don't let them do this, because you cannot check the charges until the email arrives. Get a paper copy and check it right there before you leave to be sure it's correct. I had questions about my bill that I had to call them about, and I got phone tag to 4 different people before I got an answer - so make sure you get a printout of your bill before you leave, and check it. I will not be staying at this hotel again, but I want to be fair and note that the staff there are among the best I have met, so there are positives, but the basic furniture in the room is so uncomfortable that a good night's sleep is not possible - be warned."

For this price, it is extremely value for money. With Harris Teeter, CVS and several restaurants nearby, it's very convenient. I must say the wifi at Hilton is really good as I can get some signal at Harris Teeter! The room is big and clean, the only downside was that the mattress was too hard and I couldn't sleep at all on the first night. Gotta get some Red Bull from Harris Teeter the next day in order to stay awake for sightseeing. There is a club across the street but it did not affect me as I requested for a quiet room so I had a room facing the other side. Couldn't hear any noise from the club even on Friday and Saturday. However, the soundproofing between rooms needs to be improved as I've got very noisy neighbours on both sides on my last night. The hotel staff were very friendly, especially Thomas!

I would suggest it to others, but would also tell them to check around the DC area for other places that would be better. Here is my experience.The Good: 1. The price (we booked through the Hilton website & got a better deal than any of the other ""discount"" websites were offering). 2. The hotel & our room was very clean (that's always a plus). 3. Staff was friendly (although we called for ""firm pillows"" and it took two calls to get them after waiting 40 mins. The person I spoke to was very apologetic on the phone.) 4. The fitness room & pool area is nice.5. It is close to the NoMa-Gallaudet Metro stop.5. Our hotel room was quiet (we saw lots of people & lots of kids throughout hotel but once in our room and time to sleep didn't hear any noise from outside our room.)The Bad:1. I understand it is for security reasons but having to the use your key to ""swipe"" every time you want to get to your floor on the elevator is confusing until you get used to it. I understand using these cards for hotel room doors and to enter the pool/fitness center/business center/ect for security, but having to do this in the elevator was extreme in my opinion and I spent more time on the elevator that I would have liked because of not swiping my card even though another person had swiped there & it wouldn't stop at my floor until I did it. It was annoying & didn't always work the first time I thought I swiped it. 2. The rooms are very small (bedroom & bathroom). We stayed in a regular room with two queen beds. There was three of us, me, my husband and child. I felt like we were constantly bumping into each other or other objects in the room just trying to move around. Then add in our luggage and it made the room feel even smaller. 3. The TV channels listed on the page that was provided in the room were not correct. Some were but 5 or 6 were different and there was only 1 channel for younger children. 4. The lighting was also confusing because the room was small you'd think there would be different lighting around the entrance of the room and the bathroom light. However if you used the light at the opening of the door it lit up two lights that basically lit up the entire room because the room was small, maybe there should just be an option for one light to light up and a dimmer switch? Also the bathroom light switch is outside the bathroom, when you have a small child who gets up in the middle on of the night to use the bathroom in a strange place then everyone is up because they are scared and don't know remember where the switch is once in the bathroom.5. The last issue is the bed. The opinion of the mattress is totally subjective I understand that, and I have to note that my husband was beyond THRILLED by the firmness of the bed. I however was not. I do not like that firm of a bed, I felt like I sleep on the floor with a pillow top cover thrown over top. 6. My other issue with the bed is the wooden platform the mattress sits on. There are sharp corners are the end of the bed and because of the small room, I hit the same side of the same leg 4 times I was in the room. We only stayed one night. I tried to be careful after the 1st time but when I was running to help my child in the bathroom in the middle of the night or just move around to get from one point of the room to get around the bed, I managed to hit it a couple of more times. I got a nasty bruise which I posted pics of here as well as the corner of the bed I'm talking about. I did tell the hotel desk at check out and suggested they put a soft bumper on edges because I literally had trouble with the walking tour we did of D.C. the next day because of that bruise & how bad it hurt (I even iced it down the next day before the walking tour to hope to help the pain & swelling). The hotel desk staff expressed to me that I was not the first person to make this suggestion and would ""make note of it""."

The HGI we normally stay at was sold out so we stayed here. First they gave us a room that was under renovation, the bathroom was inaccessible. The second room had air scrubbers working when we walked in. Uuugghhh!!!! The room key didn't work and had to be replaced. Not once did they mention of upgrading our room or a discount for our trouble. The bed was squeaky as hell and oh so uncomfortable. 4 am when we checked out couldn't come soon enough. Next time I will take the 45 minutes and drive back to Maryland."

Valet parking is $30, plus 18% tax. When approaching the front desk we were greeted with a smile and professionalism, by not only the young lady that assisted us, but two males at the front desk as well. We had arrived several hours before the official check-in time, but were able to access our room without delay. Being Hilton Honors members we were given our two complementary bottled waters; my daughter and I snagged those, leaving Dad empty handed. As we walked away, one of the male employees gave my husband a bottled water, saying he hated to leave Dad out and that they could spare a third water. We shared a good laugh and certainly appreciated that simple act of true hospitality. Our room #709 was a double queen overlooking a courtyard and an office building. The room was spacious and spotless with pleasing modern décor. The hotel appeared to be newer, as it showed no signs of age. The air conditioner did a fine job of keeping us cool, I only wish there was an option to run the fan continuously to help knock out some of the late night noise from other guests in the hallway. The room had a microwave and mini-fridge which always comes in handy while traveling. The sheets had that hint of fresh bleach smell, which I love and the bath towels seemed brand-new; white, thick and fluffy.The hotel is located in a nicer, quieter area of DC with the nearest Metro stop one block over. There are a handful of restaurants within walking distance and one inside the hotel. Having a Harris Teeter on the corner is a plus for those in need of groceries while on travel. Starbucks lovers will be happy, on the opposite street corner is where you’ll find it. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others visiting Washington, DC. Though too far to walk to many of the major attractions, easy access to the Metro makes this an ideal lodging choice."

Several small restaurants, Starbucks and a food supermarket are situated around this hotel.- Room is very spacious, comfortable and equipped with all the facilities including a coffee maker, iron & board, microwave and Wi-Fi- Hotel offers other facilities like coin operated laundry, indoor swimming pool and gym.- A good selection of mini bar items and toiletries are available at the front desk at very minimal prices and some items (like water) were given away free of charge.- Breakfast is very good compared to similar standard hotels.

This was my last hotel room after three weeks in seven countries. And it was a welcome place of repose after so much travel. Spacious. Spotless. Crisply new. A comfortable refuge near the end of a journey. The staff, too, was welcoming and cheery. Not to mention efficient: when I left I asked for my car to be brought around. They told me five minutes.

The service they gave was excellent also.After arriving at reception, we were given very prompt and friendly attention by the employees behind the desk. Our room was ready to go and we got in without any problems. Overall the room was very clean, tidy and well organised. The quality of the beds and fittings was excellent and I believe none of us had any issues sleeping overnight. The bathroom was also impeccable could not be faulted.The next morning we enjoyed a lovely varied breakfast and were able to checkout after being well rested. The hotel is a little far away from the city centre, but still in a nice part of Washington and you can catch a cab down-town easily. If you're visiting the city and feel like some great Chinese food, be sure to visit ""Mings"" in Chinatown. The food there is excellent!"

This Hilton Garden Inn is just fantastic is so many ways. I'll start with the staff because this is often the weakest area in a hotel but here it was the strongest. Everyone and I mean everyone on the staff was on point all the time showing us one of the most professionally run operations we have ever seen. We asked for a quiet room but for those who like excitement, request one facing the road and club across the street and you will have plenty to watch. The rooms are very neat and clean and the beds are firm and comfortable. A/C and heat worked great and there is complimentary WiFi which works exceptionally well. Our room had a refrigerator, microwave and safe which are important. Having the supermarket next door is perfect. Plenty of coffee and tea in the AM, and lemonade and tea in the afternoon in the lobby. Nice sitting area on 2nd floor.Our only issue was lack of hot water one morning but the staff told us they were fixing it and by the evening it was fine. Hey, anyone can experience a mechanical issue so we easily give them a pass on this. We parked at our daughter's apartment which is nice because parking is always an expensive option in any big metro area.We did not eat at the hotel."

The hotel is directly across the street from the Ibiza nightclub that plays house music until 3am. They have to 'pat down' the patrons who enter and there are several cop cars parked in front all night long (if that gives you any idea of the clientele the club attracts). When the club finally closes at 3am hundreds of drunk people spill into the street and there are police sirens, fighting, swearing, horn blaring. I'm awake and having the worst nightmare. The staff downstairs are indifferent. What's the point of having a comfortable bed if you can't fall asleep? Also, I'm on the third floor. Only 4 rooms on this floor. It's near the pool and housekeeping and the entire floor reeks like chlorine and bleach. It's been a horrible stay which is a shame because the rooms are clean and comfortable.

It waa disappointing - the bacon was burned and the omlet was not the best I've ever had. The room was spacious and clean. There was a glass shower in the bathroom but no tub. The electric bathroom mirror was a nice addition. My only issue was the bed and A/C. Although the mattress was a Sleep Number, it was very hard and very uncomfortable no matter how I attempted to adjust it. The A/C could not be lowered past 65 degrees which was frustrating when the warm got too warm. Overall a good experience for the excellent rate I received through Hotel Tonight."

The hotel is located a short 1 1/2 block from Metro and right next to a Harris Tetter grocery store. I will admit I am a picky traveler. As a new hotel, it was clean and surprisingly modern. I think the Hilton Garden Inn brand is moreso for families, but as a solo traveler I did not feel overwhelmed by families. I would not necessarily recommend the breakfast buffet for the price - it was good just a bit high and there are a few eating places right next to the hotel. Although I was traveling to see the national monuments, it was a short ride around DC on the Metro. The neighborhood appears to be going through a lot of rebirth/renewal and has an 'up and coming' feel. I enojyed a bike ride using the rent a bike that is right in front of Harris Tetter.

We were very disappointed for the price paid: the room had a poor layout (a person with mobility problems would have difficulty getting into the bathroom), the pillows were like rocks (and the mattress pretty uncomfortable, too), the shower was NOT accessible, and the sink vanity was not level (anything that could roll off, did). The water was also dangerously hot. The electronic locks on the doors were unbelievably loud (neighbors wake you up). The breakfast (served a building over) was awful. Most of the food appeared or tasted like it had been warmed over from previous days. I thought I'd never find a muffin I didn't like, but these were like hockey pucks. The location is in need of upkeep - there were even weeds (blooming thistles) in the yard area outside the lobby. It's a great location if you're doing business on Capitol Hill, but if you don't need to walk to the Capitol every day, you can find better hotels near Metro stops."

On arrival the receptionist organised for us to be on the same floor and we ended up with adjoining rooms which was brilliant. Ok the bathrooms weren’t massive but they were exceptionally clean, showers good and a great tv for the boys!! All the staff were very friendly and helpful, the only downside I would say is that we had a grab and go breakfast which was ok! Hotel was very convenient for sightseeing and the bus tour company stopped outside. Very central, Capitol building 10 minutes walk. Would recommend."

The staff are very nice and helpful. We wanted a room with two beds and we got a room which was actually two adjacent rooms. The couch in the other room could be converted into a full size bed and both rooms had large TVs.I want to mention about the breakfast specifically as I found it to be most generous and with plenty of options. They had everything from fruits, porridge, bread, cereals, omelets or scrambled eggs, cheese, turkey meat, salami, boiled eggs, baked potatoes, juice, muffins and cakes. Apart from this they had nice happy hours with wines. Tea/coffee, juice and lemon water was always free at the reception.The hotel is located just behind the Library of Congress building and steps away from Capitol South metro station which makes it very convenient to either go to the National Mall walking or take the metro to different places.Just a block away from the hotel on Pennsylvania avenue there are lots of restaurants, pubs and cafes so food was also very easy to get after a long day of walking through the streets of DC.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Washington DC. Two thumbs up and thank you!Wonderful service and nice staff . I would definitely stay here when I visit again. The gym was also well kept. The food they serve was delicious just that you have to get there early. Everything is almost with I walking distance if you do not want to rent a vehicle. And the hotel as well have bicycles available to use."

Taxis are always available on same corner as entrance. Taxi from here to Jefferson Memorial was $14 for the four of us. The concierge service was great, smiling faces, and knowledgeable staff. Wine hour from 5p-6p. Flavored water, coffee, tea always available. We stayed in the 2nd building that has full kitchenettes in the room (stove, microwave, full fridge, table), a great choice for families. The breakfast service was great, with well stocked selections (meat of the day, cheese of the day, eggs, bakery, bagels/toast, cereals, oatmeal, juices, fruit, hot beverages).The room was quiet and had nice light-darkening shades. We were near the elevator, never heard it. Bathroom is small, but well laid out with everything you need. Amazing towels, and robes. Bed was comfortable with a selection of firm and softer pillows. Lovely linens.I must say this is the hotel where the employees have impressed me the most, starting with David at the front dest , cleaning staff on 1st floor and with the kitchen ladies in the breakfast!! They all accomodated our needs in any way possible. We stayed here to raise funds for Vieques en el Corazon because we live in Vieques, Puerto Rico and sold our paintings and pictures because we live in Vieques and wanted to help!! Thanks for all the help! I want to congratulate the owners for taking such good care of having happy and helpful employees!!! We are very impressed also with the room, bed, refrigerator, microwave, products, tv, desk... all of great quality!!! The location is just but another extraordinary thing at this hotel!! The breakfast was deliciuos and with variety with hot and cold options! Coffee and tea all day and a happy hour!!! Wowww!!! Again, very impressed! It is just great in every way... with a gym and a business center with computers... I would continue but I have to go... All was Superb!!!"

This was a reason to give it a 4 not a 5. There’s also oatmeal & breads & jellies & cereal. Other than that the location is 1 block from the Capitol South Metro & 2 blocks from the Supreme Court & Capitol. Dinner at Sonoma & lunch at Firehook Cafe around the corner is a plus!

The staff was super friendly and the room was quite large, comfortable and super clean. That being said, the bathroom was a bit small and cramped. Seems like the hotel was recently renovated as everything seemed nice and new. The hotel is close to the Capitol, lots of shops/restaurants and isn't far from Union Station as well (about a 5 minute cab ride). I will look to choose this hotel in the future and look forward to returning. My only complaint is that the hotel has digital room keys only vs standard plastic room keys. While the industry is going in that direction and many hotels are starting to offer digital keys, the digital key was the only option at the hotel. Unfortunately, this requires downloading an app and then it takes a few minutes of set up to get everything going, Unfortunately my digital key didn't work and we had to troubleshoot for a few minutes which caused check in to take about 15-20 minutes which was frustrating. This also caused a bit of a line at check in which is unfortunate. I am all for offering a digital key, but it should not be the only option until the kinks are worked out."

We came home and were pregnant a few weeks later! During our stay at the hotel we were given a coffee mug by the person who checked us in as a annaversy gift then we bought another to match. Not knowing how special they would be. Fast forward to a week ago my daughter pulled our empty coffee cups off the counter and shattered them. We were devistated. I emailed customer service to ask if I could buy another set and the amazing man who wrote me back and told me he would purchase them for us and ship them all the way to Hawaii for free!!! I can’t explain how much this selfless act means to my husband and I! We loved our hotel stay because of the clean quality but their customer service is the best!

The lowest we could set our thermostat was 65 degrees but it couldn’t have been accurate. It felt more like 75 degrees. We asked to have it lowered but all they could offer was a box fan. The windows don’t open and there is no vent in the bathroom. Our room felt like a sauna after my husband and I each took a short shower. Blow drying my hair and getting dress were very uncomfortable. The bathroom and shower are very small and only one person can use it at a time. The mattress was firm but the pillows were lumpy. There is no light over the kitchenette area. The elevators are slow and the ice machine is on the first floor. Twice we had to get our keys reprogramed because they failed to work. The building is old and it appears that an inexpensive remodel was attempted. Instead of removing the “popcorn “ ceilings, several coats of paint were applied over it. A 25 year old a/c unit which was switched off for the winter is the only way to get circulation in the room. So, it was uncomfortablely hot."

On arriving at the hotel we got a lovely warm welcome from reception who quickly checked us in and explained where the coffee bar was, breakfast and also how to get to our rooms. The rooms were very clean and spacious and all came with air con. On entering the room we received a we note to say welcome to the hotel along with some sweets and buns. The bed was quite big and came with comfortable pillows and extra blankets if needed. They had a good selection off TV channels in the room along with microwave, sink and storage space next to the bathroom.Bathroom was a bath shower which was fine as it had a good powerful shower and new towels were provided daily. Down at reception you were able to purchase snacks, candy and microwavable food also to save going out to the shop. Where the hotel is you are within walking distance to Capital Building and the Hop on bus tours. I would highly recommend this hotel and plan to come back again in the near future. Kind Regards.My King room was large and clean. The ded was very comfortable, particularly after a long haul flight. Little to no excessive street noise allowed for a uninterrupted sleep. All staff I encountered were friendly and very helpful. A close walk to some eateries as well as metro stations. Overall very happy with my stay."

I chose this hotel because it was theoretically walking distance from both the start and the finish. Large city marathon, complicated logistics. Luckily, the hotel did everything imaginable to make it a comfortable night and a smooth day.I loved the charm and individuality of the hotel. Whoever decorated the lobby did so with creativity with plush upholstery and vibrant mixed patterns. There is a common room where breakfast is served, which has an urn of infused water at all times. The morning of the marathon, they had coffee there early on. It was a welcoming, soothing place to be when one is keyed up for a big day. There were quite a few participants staying there.The staff were friendly and accomodating. They were aware of the race, and knew exactly how to give me walking directions to the start, also offering several times to call me a car. I thought it was extra cute that they welcome pets. I had a smile watching some of the woofers parade in and out of the lobby.The room was very comfortable, with adjustable heat. The bathroom was lovely ,with L'Occitane products.There was a microwave and a mini fridge, so I was able to enjoy a quiet warmed-up dinner from home using my free wifi, which is exactly of what you need the night before a marathon. Looking for restaurants and sitting through dinner can really eat away into your sleep time. Everything was in working order and immaculate. There were plenty of glasses.I really lucked out with the valet parking, as my car got placed a few steps from the doorway. I was able to obsessively go through my stuff and pack the car in the wee hours of the morning without having to request the valet every time.Doing the full Marathon, and not the Half, I was not able to get a late checkout that enabled me to keep the room and shower. They did welcome me to use their lobby bathroom to change and freshen up after the race. I would recommend this hotel for any sort of visitor to DC. If you are in for DCMarathon 2018, and are up for a little walk or cab ride each way, this is a great place to stay. i would choose it again."

They typically have 15% or 20% off on the rooms, so visiting Truvago to find a 'good deal' shouldn't yeild better results.The neighborhood is nice and safe and it's enjoyable to walk freely outside. Pennsylvania Avenue and 8th Street have various shops and restaurants within walking distance from the hotel.Check-in was quick, staff were friendly and very accommodating. The valet parking was expensive, but very convenient. Pay close attention to where you will have to park if you don't purchase the hotel valet.Room 409 was clean, modern and felt very comfortable. Our room had two queen beds, a small kitchen and dining area, and a very nicely updated (but small) bathroom with a connected walk in closet area.We watched HBO and snacked on restaurant leftovers we placed in the kitchens​ fridge. We slept well and enjoyed our morning showers. We didn't partake in the free breakfast but the offerings looked well prepared and many other guest send to be enjoying everything. Check out was just as easy as checking in and the staff just as friendly.We spent 4 nights at the hotel, and found that they provided comprehensive and friendly services to their guests. Impressed by their valet parking services; complimentary wine and tea break sessions; laundry and gym rooms, we like the breakfast too though at one time, we observed insufficient seats for guests who came around 9:45am and need to bring food off the site. Apart from this, we have total satisfaction toward their customer services. Beside, the hotel honored our request for a quiet room. The receptionists including Patricia gave good suggestions on transportation as well as dining options. Will certainly recommend travelers to patronize this hotel and hope to be back one day!"

The pull-out was not stellar, my older son said it was not very comfortable, but he managed.The bathroom was small, but had everything we needed. Shower had great pressure and the provided toiletries were heavenly smelling.There was enough room for us to not be in each others way all the time. Not that we wanted to spend our hours in the hotel! D.C. is a magical place, full of history and beauty. The Capitol Hill Hotel was so close that the only thing between us and the Library of Congress - Jefferson Building was a couple of deli's, literally! There was delicious food within 5-10 minutes walk, Pizza, Tacos, Italian or regular American fare. Plus, a Saloon bar with great bartenders that are begging you to let them invent something for you.If there were any items I would have liked to change it would be that first, the pillows were a little too full. I had to steal a smaller one from the kids bed. And two, the breakfast wasn't great. We were there 5 nights and it was pretty much the same each time; oatmeal, eggs, sausage, toast/pastry, cereal, juice/coffee. But the bakery around the corner took care of that handily."

What a pleasant trip and hotel! The rate was great and the room with its 2 queen beds, small kitchen and dining area was awesome! Our room had been recently remodeled with wood floors and new sitting area furniture. The bathroom was very modern and the shampoo and conditioner included is now my wife's favorite. She has already ordered it in Amazon. The only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer. If I had to name something I didn't like it would be the $50 per night Parking fee. Unfortunately any hotel has about the same charge. The staff were first class and the breakfast which was included in price was more than adequate! The location of the Capitol Hill hotel is phenomenal. The neighborhood is great with alot of cool places to eat and bars to wind down after a long day. We walked from the hotel all the way down the National Mall to the White House and back logging about 9 miles. If you don't want to walk, the hotel has bikes for rent out front. We are already looking forward to our next trip back!"

It is closest hotel to Congress. Shortly before coming I injured my knee. Hotel staff was able to move me to a handicap room on short notice. I had to use a electric scooter and a walker. Throughout my stay they were overly accommodating and made me feel like a family member. Their assistance to me and my wife exceeded all expectations. It was raining one morning and to get to the breakfast room you have to go outside and go about a half block to the breakfast area. The staff member walked with me as I tried to maneuver the sidewalk holding an umbrella over me. Never would have expected that. You can tell the staff truly enjoy there positions. The rooms were great but the hospitality was beyond belief. I will definitely stay here again!! If I could give 10 stars I would.

Plenty of local dining options, from Mexican to French to Vietnamese to burgers. A 30 minute stroll from Union Station and just 3 Metro stops from the Smithsonian. Perfect!We received an upgrade to a one bedroom suite on check-in, so felt very spoilt. Love the decor - funky historic - coffee and tea and iced water available all day. We were in the top floor of the 2nd building ( where complimentary breakfast is served in the lobby - great hot and cold selection!! ) and enjoyed views across the row houses - lovely!! Courteous staff, helpful and gracious, made us feel very valued on every interaction!! L'Occitane toiletries added to the sense of luxury, alongside high quality bed linen and fluffy thick towels. Great pillows and very comfortable King bed. Small kitchen with a full-size fridge, lots of storage and a generous sized living room ( also very stylishly furnished ). TV's in both lounge room and bedroom had patchy reception that frequently pixilated - but you shouldn't be watching TV when there is so much to explore in D.C !! - particularly all the glorious free museums and galleries!!!Perfect location, perfect hotel...

I took Uber from Reagan National that cost less than $15 each way -- a 25 minute ride in traffic and less than 15 minutes for my early morning departure. A 10 minute walk will get you to the Capitol and Union Station and every form of public transportation you'll need. The National Mall is close by to enjoy all DC has to offer. There are a variety of restaurants within a five minute walk where I found Sweetgreens that serves super fresh salads made to order. There are also a couple of pubs and a liquor store in this area. The hotel includes a daily breakfast that isn't gourmet but has enough variety to satisfy everyone in your group. The room decor was pleasant and the layout comfortable. It included a mini-kitchen, in room safe, shampoo, conditioner and soap dispensers in the shower and a VERY comfortable bed with quality bedding. I felt safe in the neighborhood at all times. The staff was friendly but not meddlesome and everyone from the front desk to housekeeping to kitchen staff were keen to ensure happy guests. On weeknights, they serve cold white wine and red wine in the lounge from 5-6 pm. There isn't much to do for young children (no pool or play area) but I did see small pets. They have several hotel bikes for guest use on a first come first served basis. I really enjoyed my long stay and will come back again."

We took the train to DC and only stayed one night. The hotel was lovely. The location is great as it is in a neighborhood, yet one block from the Library of Congress. The rooms were very clean and the staff was top notch. They were more than helpful with suggestions for both navigating the city during our short stay and where to grab a drink. The continental breakfast was much more that we expected with eggs and breakfast meats, pastries, bagels and cream cheese and more. The coffee was also above par as were the aesthetics in the breakfast room. I can't say enough about this place. I'll be going back. If I had to make one complaint, it would be that the pillows were new and I like a flat as a pancake pillow. I'm pretty sure that doesn't qualify as a complaint but that's really the only thing that comes to mind. The bed was very comfortable."

GREAT L'Occtaine toiletries.CONS: I barely have anything negative to say about our stay. The only issues we had were that the digital safe in our room was a little glitch and I would have to repeatedly enter our code a few times in order for it to open and that the room wasn't soundproofed, so we heard occasional hallway door noise and traffic/trucks.We recently spent a week in DC, and picked the Capitol Hill Hotel for our stay. Located 1 1/2 blocks from the Metro Blue Line, no car is necessary. The hotel is walking distance from everything on Capitol Hill, including the Library of Congress, Shakespeare Library, Supreme Court, Mall, and the Capitol. Good restaurants just a few blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue. The staff is courteous and very professional. The rooms are well appointed, some with kitchenettes.

Hot sausage and eggs. Cheese and cold cuts. Hot oatmeal. Great pastries. One of the best things about this hotel is the staff. Our Sunday and Morning breakfasts were very crowded, but there were at least 3 people visible at all times refilling things and directing guests to empty tables. The capable staff made the difference in my 5 star review. If some of you are a little picky, there are some nicks in the paint here and there, but all the advantages of this hotel outweigh those. I experienced absolutely no noise problems and there was a wedding going on at the hotel. Our view was lovely. We stayed in 307. The location cannot be beat.

Breakfast goes until 11 on the weekend. Improvement: I wish they had feminine toiletries for a girl emergency. I couldn't go to any of the stores in the middle of the night because everything was closed. Even the metro according to google. I was able to deal so I didn't bother w/ taking a taxi to a walgreens, but it still would've helped a lot if they sold those items at that little stand next to the front counter.

I absolutely love the diverse staff, even getting a chance to talk to a few of the staff from different areas of the world that were so happy to talk about where they are from (the US history teacher in me always comes out!). My family and I stayed two nights and went to both home NATS games. It was nearly a mile walk, a little rough on the kids when it's midnight and super hot, but truly went by fast. When you can see the US Capitol building, see some of the old buildings of the city, parks, landscaping.....it is all worth it. During the day we walked to the Eastern Market, about a 10 minute walk to GREAT little restaurants. We stopped at one pizza place, Seventh Hill Pizza on 7th Street that was a little on the pricy side, but SO GOOD. The pizzas were fast and the service fantastic. There is also a We The Pizza right around the corner from the hotel that is FANTASTIC!!!! Pizza not as good as Seventh Hill, but cheaper, huge eating area, and great drink selection. It's a great atmosphere!!The hotel itself.....the building you check into has rooms there as well as a building adjacent to it. We stayed in the adjacent building. The complimentary breakfast was great. And I highly suggest getting the parking deal when making a reservation. Parking was a breeze and breakfast great. I liked that breakfast was in the building where we stayed. Our room was spacious....felt like an apartment. (due to the fact it used to be townhomes I believe earlier). We had a full fridge, microwave, stovetop, Keurig coffee maker....it was great! The bathroom was small and other reviews complained, but I don't need a big bathroom, so it didn't bother me!

This hotel is a very short walk (3-4 blocks/5-7 minutes) to the House buildings and to the Capitol. There are two buildings. The one on the corner is where you check in, the other building is where the breakfast is held. I stayed on the 4th floor of the second building. The suite was very large with a bathtub, and a kitchenette (sink, microwave, and refrigerator). Maid service was good. No room service, but you are close to a few small restaurants. Easy check-in. Robes, umbrella, iron, ironing board, safe and utensils are in the room. Nice thermostats/temperature control in the rooms. Good window covers to keep out light. The breakfast was great; scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, lunch meats, cheeses, oatmeal, muffins, biscuits, cereal, yogurt, juice, coffee, toast. The breakfast area is crowded, but the turnover is fast. Perhaps the table could be wiped down in between guests, but other than that I was very happy with it.

It was comforting to go back to our hotel room at the end of the day and be able to relax.The hotel itself looks exactly like the pictures online. It had a sleek and modern environment with a wine hour from 5-6pm on week days. They had one red and white selection. Every guest gets one free glass during this wine hour. The Continental breakfast was great! We stayed in the main building and had to walk to the east building next door to enjoy it but it's not far, worth the walk. There is a wide selection of foods. If you don't want to go to the east building, there are also options in the west building: bread, granola bars, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and fresh fruit.

Drawbacks are the lack of restaurants nearby. The hotel has a complimentary breakfast that could benefit from greater variety. Our room had a kitchen area that included a Keurig that was bereft of coffee creamers! Not the full complimentary service expected. All in all, a very nice 'home' away from home."

I flew into Reagan National then took the metro from the airport to the Capitol South station for a total train ride of about 20 minutes that only cost around $3 one way. The hotel was then a pretty easy 2 block walk east from the Capitol South station. The area is mostly residential walk-ups and government office buildings so it is very secure and light traffic in the immediate area. The hotel is directly east of some Congressional offices and south of the Library of Congress and was within walking distance of the Capitol, Supreme Court and a host of other buildings. I walked several times to the Smithsonian area and it wasn't too bad at all, but if you prefer you can take the metro, a cab or use one of the bicycles belonging to the hotel which they will loan you for free.The rooms are pretty spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The room I was in had a small 2 person dining table, sofa and kitchenette area with a full size refrigerator, ice maker, sink, microwave and cooktop in a little nook area. They even provided some dishes, silverware and glassware as well as some pots and pans. It isn't as much as a full sized kitchen, of course, but plenty to let you avoid eating out every meal until you are sick of doing it. To the east there are some shops such as a CVS Pharmacy and an organic produce store where you can buy a few things such as bread, peanut butter, ginger ale, fruit etc. to keep on hand. There is also a farmers market to the east somewhere, but it was closed when I was there. There are also quite a few small places to eat ranging from sushi and thai to more common Subway sandwich shops etc.The hotel also offers a very nice breakfast from 630 to 10 which is advertised as ""continental"" but is actually a good deal nicer than standard continental. It has apple juice, orange juice, coffee, a nice selection of fruit, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, pastries, cereal, milk and at least one type of meat and cheese to pair with your eggs (one day was ham and swiss, while another was salami and provolone). No omelet bar or made to order waffles, but certainly more than mere continental. They even offer a complimentary USA Today and Washington Post (until they run out) in the breakfast area. I was very impressed overall and only had two complaints. First, there was a somewhat raucous party on the first night I arrived which was a Sunday. They finally put away their bongos around 11 though so it was fine I suppose. Second, they seemed a little stingy with the TP and kleenex with hardly any in the room when I arrived and barely ever giving me more than an immediate supply even when requesting more. I would still stay here again, but it just seemed like an odd thing to be stingy with in a nice hotel like this.Overall though an outstanding hotel in a great area that is conveniently located to just about anything you could ever want to do in Washington D.C. for business or pleasure."

Kitchen was well equipped and overall spacious. Lots of storage space too. Breakfast was a very decent spread and replenished quickly. It's convenient to get to the metro and some eateries close by too. There's valet parking which is very flexible. Overall great service and we'll definitely head back there.

The refurbished decor was well appointed and not bad value, comparatively speaking. especially as a decent continental-style breakfast was included in the tariff. The breakfast dining room is a little cramped but kind of fun, with the sort of conspiratorial chatter and interesting characters that might be expected to be visiting one of the world's most influential capitals. The leafy semi-suburban location is very pleasant and quite handy to government institutions and modestly priced restaurants. It is nice stroll to Union Station where the tourist buses hangout. The friendly and helpful staff made our two day stay particularly memorable. Highly recommended."

Luckily I came across this hotel. The location is very good - it's just a 5 minute walk from the Metro station (Capitol South), and it's close to the National Mall and Capitol Building. It's surrounded by houses, so it seems like you're in a neighborhood. And just a block away, there are nice restaurants and bars.Check in was very quick and the staff was very friendly. I didn't know that my room was located in the next building, but luckily the complimentary continental breakfast was located in this building. When I got to my room, my key wouldn't work, so I had to go back to the front desk in the other building. The front desk was nice and offered to walk me to the room just to make sure the key worked. Luckily it did the second time.The room was very simply, but I loved the layout. The room was big and had a huge walk in closet and restroom. Towards the back there was dining area and a small kitchen with a full size refrigerator. The view out the window wasn't the best, but I was only there for one night and had to leave early in the morning so my window shades were closed the entire time. The decor in the hallways and lobby is really trendy. It really seemed welcoming and comforting with a modern feel.The breakfast was very impressive. There was a nice selection of breads, cereal, fruit, juices, and coffee. There was also a coffee station situated by the elevators for those who wanted to grab coffee on the way out the door."

Staff was very accommodating, pleasant, and considerate! They gave personal attention to every detail of our stay. Very impressed! Loved the location...closest to Marine Barracks, walk to the Mall, museums, delis, restaurants, the White House, Capitol, Metro, etc. We were so thankful to be given an early check-in after flying a ""red-eye"" flight to DC, and then were given a late check-out to accommodate our departure time. The hotel offers a nice business center where we printed our our boarding passes at no charge. Nice laundry facilities, work-out room, and Breakfast Room as well.We enjoyed our large Queen Deluxe Suite which had modern decor, comfy beds, pillows and linens. It offered a full-size closet/dressing room and full kitchen. The bathroom was clean, nice and had a good shower head with plenty of hot water and pressure. Nice quality soaps/shampoos provided. Air Conditioner worked great and kept us very comfortable. Downsides: The view outside of our window was the back of another building...not great, but we weren't there that much anyway. No table of any kind to sit and eat at, and no privacy curtains or room-darkening shades in our particular room, only a sheer Roman shade.The complimentary breakfast was wonderful...a variety of fresh bagels, with lots of options to top it with....cream cheese, butter, peanut butter, jam or honey. You can also make a nice breakfast sandwich by putting sliced deli meats and real cheese slices on bagels or toast. They had 3 kinds of cereal, whole milk, OJ and Cranberry juice, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, and oatmeal packets. Just don't be late or some items are gone and they put the food away promptly! You'll love this modern, restored hotel in the beautiful historic neighborhood which felt safe and clean. A+ for staff service! Thank you...we'll be back!"

We had a very personal wedding in D.C. (just us, no family/friends). I wanted to surprise my spouse by having roses and a cake waiting for us in the room after our ceremony. I emailed the hotel and the manager, Norbert, arranged everything within a few days before we were to arrive. On Sunday, my spouse remembered that we didn't order our flowers for the ceremony. So, just as before, Norbert came through on a SUNDAY, and picked up and delivered our flowers to our room the next Morning just before we were leaving for our ceremony. When we returned after the ceremony, the cake and flowers awaited us as planned. But he had brought in a table complete with tablecloth as well as champagne and a card signed by all of the staff! So, we were BOTH surprised! The staff did everything to make our stay fabulous. The location of this hotel was close to most of the museums. Needless to say we will return every year for our anniversary and any other time we go back! I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel for your stay in DC!"

What a great stay! The location was convenient for my business-oriented stay, the meeting venue was nearby and everything was smooth and easy. The hotel has a very pleasant, helpful staff. The wifi was really fast and whenever a little problem occurred with it (my own fault!) or any other help was needed, the helpfull staff was there right away to assist me happily.The hotel had a beautiful lobby and the room was spacious and nicely decorated. The air condition was efficient and the bed was comfortable. And the breakfast was just superb - who needs lunch after it?! If you still do, there are a couple of very nice restaurants just around the block. The neighborhood around the hotel was beautiful as well.It was easy to get a cab if I wished to see the city and the staff was always there to help me get one. The nearest metro station was just around the block. One great thing I really need to mention about this hotel is that the hotel even has a complimentary wine tasting every day at 5PM. Wow, what a service!"

We arrived a little early and took a moment to walk and enjoy the neighborhood. However, when we arrived back at 4:00pm our room was not ready. The man behind the desk (do not recall his name but had a French accent) was very unhelpful and did not seem concerned. Luckily, another gentleman stepped in and was very knowledgeable and explained that they had delays due to housekeeping and the volume of the cherry blossom festival. This was annoying, but at least he had his ducks in a row and did show concern (finally got our room at 4:30).Beyond beginning, we did enjoy the hotel and the location options it offered. The breakfast was a nice surprise, not your typical small hotel size. The other hotel staff members were very polite and helpful and made our stay great. The room size was great for our family of four and the full size refrigerator was a blessing. The hotel's location to the mall and the capital south metro station was a blessing and the ""hill"" neighborhood offered great restaurants and friendly people as well. Overall we enjoyed our time at this hotel and when we return to DC, this will be our first option."

So when we found out this is a dog friendly hotel I jumped at the chance to make a family trip. While making the arrangements months in advance I had told the reservations department we had two large dogs. Both over 50lbs. This they said was not a problem. We were so excited. So the trip was planned. Well the night before I decided, since we were traveling quit a distance, to call and confirm. Well, what started out to be a simple trip almost turned bad! Not only did the front desk keep transferring me to someone else who would then transfer me back to the front desk, that person would then put me on hold. I had to keep hanging up and calling back. The not so nice front desk person on duty then informed me they only took one dog and it had to be 25lbs. So we could take the chance and come down if we wanted too! Well I had all my notes for the original confimation and I informed him we would be coming and they would honor this. Well of course I went on to work on a back of plan if we wound up with no place to stay. I had bought this deal thru TravelZoo and it could not be refunded or used at a different date so off we went. We had plans with family in the area and I was not about to disappoint my nephew, who had been waiting for weeks to see us! We drove down and along the way I figured I would give another try to speaking with someone else and this is where Hichem Aloulou comes in. He promised me he would see to our stay and we would have no trouble. I was the first to go in to the hotel. After the crazy mass confusion of the original reservations and phone calls the night before I was taking no chances. I was alittle unsure of the trustworthiness of this adventure with good cause. Well I was immediately greeted by Hichem Aloulou who knew who I was and he was so pleasant and professional. This whole stay was turned around by the wonderful Manager on Duty Hichem Aloulou. I went out and got my husband, daughter and the 2 dogs. They staff looked alittle unsure as to what was going on at first but then all was well. They warmed up to the dogs after seeing they really are just like little children. We had a wonderful stay and the room was perfect the way it was. All guests with dogs are required to stay on the first floor. These rooms are a one bedroom and a living room with a kitchen. Which by the way is equipped with a sink and dishes. Perfect for us since you have to stay with the dogs in the room we ordered from a local pizza place and had dinner in! They said they are doing renovations and upgrades but this was not a problem at all. Hichem went out of his way to make our stay so pleasant it actually felt as comfortable as being at home. Hichem even brought us up another lamp after I had mentioned I was having a hard time reading because the room was too dark. Everything from bones in the main entrance for the dogs, dog beds, water bowls for the dogs, games for the kids in the lobby toy chest, wine for the adults in the library, breakfast in the morning and an all around feel of sophistication but home town charm! The neighborhood is dog friendly which was great because it gave us a chance to go exploring and see all the history they have to offer. The rest of the staff was wonderful too! We will be back! Please give them a try they really are worth it!"

Reasonably priced.However, the hotel cites a recent complete renovation, really? The bathroom door was broken, beat up, wouldn't even close. Bathtub enamel chipped away, corners of rooms like the rest, look like they have not been attended to in 40 years. The cleaning staff woke us up every half hour (husband ill, so he slept in) by entering our room over and over again. We dead bolted the door finally, not getting the hint; they kept pounding the door through where door caught on the lock. Geniuses. Advertises free wifi, but not once did it work during our stay, kept getting error messages that it was unstable, slow or not available."

The beds, including the sofa bed and complimentary folding bed, were very comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with plates, utensils, glasses, refrigerator, microwave, stove and sink. The kitchen sink was slow to drain. The bathroom was okay, but had a little mold here and there, and the tub was slow to drain. Communal baths are also available down the hall. The room was otherwise very clean, though a little small. Our room overlooked the street, which was nice during the day, but a little bright at night -- even with the shades drawn. There were plenty of easily accessible electrical outlets. For the price, it is a very good room.The breakfast was well above average. The cereal, bagels, pastries and muffins were very good. The boiled eggs were very good. The salami and cheese slices were also very good. Complimentary teas were provided in the room and upon request. Excellent complimentary fruit waters were available in the lobby. The service was exceptional around the clock, including at breakfast. Prompt, very helpful assistance was provided in the Business Center. The staff was very friendly and eager to help. The location near the capitol building is exceptional -- 2 1/2 blocks from the Capitol South Metro station. Despite some minor issues described above, I will stay at this hotel again. There were NO bed bugs in our room, which have become ubiquitous in DC hotels."

There are some negative reviews, but the location was perfect for our needs: incredibly close to Representatives' offices and relatively low cost.At first glance, the hotel entry is a little odd. Immediately inside the door is a sitting area with a small check-in desk further inside. But the staff was immediately friendly and inviting. Check-in was quick and easy. They always greeted us upon return and every morning when we left. I got the impression that they really cared that we were taken care of well. Few times has the staff been so friendly in any location I've stayed.Rooms are spacious and clean. The beds were very comfortable with nice bedding and not-too-firm mattress. My room had several chairs, a desk area and a small kitchenette. The bathroom is probably the biggest shortcoming and the reason this hotel didn't get 5 stars. The bathrooms are very small. The toilet is small, the sink is a pedestal variety. Even the bathtub is smaller than standard. There are shelves above the toilet for some storage, but we all talked about putting the lid down on the toilet before our toiletries fell in. Unlike some reviews, we never ran out of hot water (I spoke with the rest of my party). The water was steaming hot at all times of the day.The cooling (didn't use heat) worked very well. The drapes did a good job of blocking the light. Sleeping was easy at the Capitol Hill, although there was some noise from the hallway outside.The elevators are smallish and slow. Guess what? There are stairs across the hall that work well.The good news is that I never had to wait long for an elevator. Not a great view from the rooms, but also not a view of a brick wall of the building next door.The hotel has a continental breakfast included in the price. It is extensive and tasty for a continental breakfast. It is served in the second building, not the main building. However, walking to it was no big deal, although during inclement weather it might not be the best.The Capitol Hill Hotel is one block from the Metro, one block from Cannon House Office Building and within two blocks of any of the Library of Congress buildings. You can walk to the Capitol steps in about five minutes, as well as any of the House office buildings. The Senate are a little further, but it's still closer and faster to walk than to take the Metro to Union Station - maybe a ten minute walk.The organization I work for decided we will put this hotel at the top of our list when we return. It's not as elegant as some other hotels, but it's price and location are unbeatable. If you have business on the hill and are looking for a nice, affordable, conveniently-close hotel, look no further."

I decided to stay at the Capitol Hotel due to meetings in the area. What a find! The hotel is in a wonderful neighborhood in the Capitol Hill area, with streets lined with lovely brownstones and restaurants. The hotel is off the main drag of Pennsylvania Ave, so it's very quiet in the neighborhood. That said, one block away the area is bustling with sites and restaurants. A perfect location.The room itself was quite comfortable and large. I had a corner room with views out two windows and two different streets. The bedding was nice, and there was plenty of room to work. The bathroom was sufficient and there was the convenience of a small kitchenette just off the bath area. The only complaint is that there wasn't much sink space in the bathroom, but with the small kitchenette area just off to the side (with full length mirror), this made up for the lack of space in the bathroom itself.The front desk service was wonderful, and there is a very nice lounge area off the main lobby with nice seating, coffee, tea and juices. There is also a light breakfast served here in the morning which included muffins. The largest morning breakfast is served in building right next door so even though you have to go outside, it is just steps away (I didn't take advantage of the breakfast service, only the morning muffins, which were delicious).  I would definitely stay here again if in the Capitol Hill area!"
