As a female solo traveler I felt very safe in this hitel/location. the room was nice sized, great smart TV, in room mini bar, and comfy bed, bathrobes and hair dryer in the bathroom along with complimentary tolietries. the bathroom was large and modern and clean- loved the glass walk in shower. I was on the 8th floor & had a bit of a nice view of the water/dock, which was a plus. did not eat in the hotel restuarant as the menu did not appeal to me, but luckily there are many great restaurants both fair priced and expensive within walking distance. I tried room service one night since I liked the menu more. Pretty decent but high priced as expected. It is about a mile walk to the National Mall and museums which I enjoyed. there is a self -park parking garage basically attached the the hotel for 35.00 a day. There's a cvs nearby for beverages and even some snacks and fresh, cold food (fruit/cheese). The only thing I didn't love was that my room did not have a do not disturb sign, so housekeeping came in each day.I didnt see any signs on any other doors in my hall. Housekeeping did a nice job, but I would have opted out 1 or 2 days since I was alone. Overall, the hotel location, cleanliness and friendly staff make it a 5 star hotel snd I will stay here again.New gem by the river amidst restaurants, top end bars, a music venue and shopping. Lovely new mid size rooms. There’s a good crispy chicken sandwich in the bar and highly inventive cocktail menu. Top level service and friendly smiles all around."

The room, and service however were just ok. We had called repeatedly ahead of time asking about early check in. We were told nothing could be promised until the day of arrival. We called again before we boarded our plane in New York, and still got no commitment. As we checked in around 12, we were told they’d call/text in an hour or so, when it was ready. After 2.5 hours of wandering around, no call comes. We eventually make our way back, and assert ourselves to get a room. As we checked in, we asked for a ‘fridge as we learned there isn’t one in the room. The room itself, looked a little beaten up, and was not very big. The best part was its view of the Potomac and it’s proximity to the Wharf and all the shops and restaurants. Beyond that, the ‘fridge needed to be asked for 3x. We came back one day at 4:00 and the room was still being cleaned. Another day, rubber gloves were left on our dresser. While no one item was a big deal, the whole of our experience added up to being just ok.Check in was smooth. They tried to get us a room as quickly as possible although we had arrived prior to 4pm. The staff was friendlyElevators are a bit strange, you kind of had to hit 2 buttons because the 2 on the left are separate from the 1 on the right (the one on the right goes to the rooftop pool which it was too cold to try).Our room was nice and spacious. Each room comes with a Nespresso. They give the usual toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion.While we were there, we heard the music from the wedding through the floor. We were on the 4th floor so word to the wise. The hotel was good about moving us to another floor but it is bad that a hotel has poor sound insulation like that. The area around the hotel is cool. I recommend Kith/Kin for dinner-usually reservations book up quickly here so I would book on Opentable several weeks ahead. Also, I had an amazing breakfast at Toastique which was around the corner."

We didn't arrive until late in the afternoon. At check in there were 3 staff, 2 were on the phone and 1 was hovering. We stood and waited for her to greet us, she didn't. Once the other member of staff had finished she kindly greeted us. But she then answered a phone call while still trying to talk to us, then had a little tantrum when she realised someone had took her pen! Great impression so far... We had a room on the 12th floor which is were the conference rooms are and weddings are held. Our room was big and looked like it hadn't been used much. We had a large balcony that over looked other apartments. The balcony had no chairs to sit outside and looked partly finished. We visited the Roof top bar which in the evening is lovely and a great view but expensive. All good so far....until 6am!!We were woke up with a loud noise coming from a slaming door. There is a door occupied by housekeeping staff early in the morning. It is used continuously. It slams shut every time staff go in and out. This went on and on all morning. We were exhausted. We reported it to reception and she said they would sort it. On our return to the hotel much later in the day we were looking forward to a power nap since we were woke up so early. We were in for a complete shock. Once the elevator doors opened we were confronted with a very noisy wedding party. Oh it just got better. We fought our way through the party to get to our hopefully quiet room to nap!. Once in the room we knew it would be impossible. It was so noisy. We couldn't understand why they have bedrooms on this floor with function facilities. We contacted the manager on duty Scott immediately and told him everything. He was sympathetic and very quick sorting our situation out. We had to repack everything and we were moved to the seventh floor. Our room was lovely and over looked the marina. The rooms are lovely but you can hear noises coming from other rooms. They arent very well constructed. When housekeeping are doing their job early, every time they go in and out of a room they let the doors slam. There is no need for that to happen. For our issues we had during our stay, Scott offered us a voucher for the restaurant, which was greatly appreciated. The door men, Michael on Concierge are lovely and helpful. Check in staff could learn a lesson from them.."

They built the Intercontinental in a new restaurant entertainment area with a ton of restaurants and bars. Hotel is new, clean and nice as would be expected. There’s a good restaurant downstairs and a rooftop pool/bar. There’s a nice view of the river and blue sky. I would highly recommend giving it a try."

We came into the room to champagne and strawberries as I mentioned it was my friends very special birthday hence the trip to DC and NYC, which was a lovely gesture. Ashley checked us in and mentioned they hold the FULL amount of your stay (6 nights for us), AND $150 for EACH night. I was not happy about that, so I told her so. She was very nice about it and said she would take our stay plus $300 instead of what should have been $900 ! So on with our holiday. The area is just superb, with 3 hotels, lots of gorgeous restaurants, live music, swings and the seafood market. We loved all of it and ate in the restaurants too (separate reviews for them). We had cocktails in the hotel (amazing) but no food. We met lots of nice staff and are now friends with some of the guests. Breakfast, first few days Sarah was marvellous at it ! Then it went downhill, the other days we would have to ask for orange juice (which was included with our breakfast), we had to ask for milk / cream for our coffee, sometimes butter, and once a spoon, and sometimes we had to ask twice. Staff were very pleasant but it’s annoying asking all the time for things that are included in your package. The room was amazing, and as two ladies we loved the vanity unit to sit and put your make up on. I missed a mirror in the bedroom. We had a view facing the Potomac River, just fabulous. We took the water taxis to National Harbour and went to Tanger Outlet, brilliant if you like shopping. The water taxis leave just outside the hotel, $18 return, and we also took one to a Georgetown. We ate in Del Mar, Kirwans Irish, Kaliwa and our favourite Lupo Marino. I have given the hotel 4 stars as it was amazing ! Some people would maybe give 1 star after the hassle I had, but up to the day I left for NYC we did have a ball ! I received a message while waiting for our bus to NYC from my CC company saying I had went overdrawn. I was very upset and wondered what went wrong. To cut a long stressful story short, the hotel took our 6 nights from my card, but they also had a HOLD on £2700 (POUNDS not dollars) on my card. After 3 nights £900 dropped from the hold but still £1800 was kept. I was emailing the reservations manager twice daily ( I was only in NYC for 4 nights) with NO sorry, just that they were trying to sort it out. In the 4 nights I was in NYC I could NOT use my card ! I came home yesterday and the £1800 was still on my card !!!! I have also never heard anything from the hotel. The hold was on from Sunday 26th until Saturday 1st September. Finally the hold came off today !! I will go back to DC and The Wharf but it won’t be The Intercontinental !"

Lucky bundle deals were still reasonably priced. The location was actually pretty good. Intercontinental is within walking of the mall towards the Washington monument side. The water is right outside the front door which is lined with plenty of places to dine. Beware of the price you will have to pay for anything in this area. There is a great place for coffee next door. Water taxis to Alexandrea leave from 100 meters away and Ubers were abundant in the area. The bus stop was convenient as well, just a left out the side door."

I understand it’s summer and the District is busy with tourists. I do not understand the 1970s Vegas look.Seeking a nice, relaxing night away from home, we thought we’d use our IHG Ambassador night for a little staycation. We love the Willard but decided to try the new Intercontinental. The two cannot be more dissimilar!! The comfort, class, and style so evident at the Willard is no where to be seen. From a tiny check-in area and no room to wait at valet to a noisy balcony and no ice in the ice machine, we felt we were at a Holiday Inn. Traffic was atrocious and took us 30 minutes to go two blocks. Who in Gods green earth approved the TINY side streets?! Too many people, too many cars, no police, security chatting together and not helping anyone, Kith and Kit told us a one-hour wait that turned out to be two and a half hours, buildings so close people on rooftops looked into our room when I opened the balcony door, people on top of people, a bathroom mirror mounted for someone 4’5” tall, and too soft beds. The developers tried to squeeze every inch out of this place and you can tell. The turnarounds can hardly accommodate an SUV.It felt cheap and not Intercontinental quality. One of my worst stays at any IHG property.We will absolutely NOT be back.I recommend going to the Willard instead.- Spire Elite member"

We needed the sun by the rooftop pool after bad summer in Iceland. Great to be there. Rooms were great, bit cold sometimes, Nespresso top nice. Only minus, we got to the gym 5 times but only 2 times they had water bottles!Thank you for good time.Beautiful room, great service, wonderful location. Everything was perfect from start to finish with the roof top bar and pool being our favorite part of the stay. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we were happy and special kudos to the concierge Mark! Location by the wharf was great with plenty to do and lots of great restaurants. Will definitely be back."
