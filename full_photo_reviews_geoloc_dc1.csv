From the moment you arrive, you are treated like a queen. A friendly doorman opens the door and greets you with a smile. The lobby has fruit-infused water for guests. The front desk is manned by caring and helpful staff who are willing to go above and beyond for every guest. We arrived two hours early and when I asked if we could leave our bags, the front desk staff immediately offered to see if we could check in and then found us a room. The room was a spacious double/double suite with a huge kitchen. I could have cooked a Thanksgiving turkey in the oven! The kitchen has a full-size fridge, pots, pans, dishware, silverware, spatula, coffee maker, toaster, and even fresh coffee beans and a coffee grinder! You can order groceries from the front desk, but we popped over to a nearby CVS to get eggs, bagels, butter, and milk. This allowed us to make a delicious breakfast each morning before we set out on our adventures. We were delighted to return to our room and discover that Housekeeping had washed all our dishes each day. Thank you so much for going way above and beyond here. The room was spacious. We had two closets. The bathroom had a separate area for the shower and toilet. The water was hot and great pressure in the shower. The body wash and shampoo and condition smelled amazing. The whole place was very clean. The beds were luxurious and I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. We had a nice balcony with a table and chairs. We heard a bit of street noise during the night, but that's to be expected in a city.The location is super convenient for DuPont Circle and Georgetown too. Easy walking or quick Uber. The metro ride from Union Station was quick and easy. The hotel was a block or two from the Foggy Bottom stop and 5-6 blocks from Farragut West. The hotel hosts a free wine hour for guests between 5-6 pm in the lobby, which was yet another great perk. Sandra and Tea felt like friends by the time we checked out and we will definitely be back here again to see them in the spring!This is truly the kind of place you want to come back to again and again and is our new home away from home in DC.Thank you so much for making our stay such a terrific experience!"

It was a great location since we were across the circle from the Foggy Bottom metro station and from a Wholefoods and Starbucks. There was a happy hour in the lobby each night we were there and we enjoyed trying the different wines. It did get loud from sirens occasionally because there's a hospital across the circle, but it didn't keep me from getting a good nights sleep. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My TV wasn't working at 10:30pm, so I called and they sent someone up to fix it in a very timely manner. I would definitely stay here again."

The furniture/style is a little outdated but that's the only 'negative' thing. The rooms are really big with a full working kitchen, big nice bed and decent shower.

Location is great, a short walk from Foggy Bottom metro station and a Whole Foods store. Also, great for jogging on the Potomac waterfront (about 7-8 minutes away from the hotel).The rooms are vast, especially comared to NYC. It has a big anteroom with plenty of space as well as a big open wardrobe space in the bathroom anteroom. Also, a full kitchen with everything you need to have meals in the room. We did not cook but it was handy to buy everything at Whole Foods and have breakfast on the balcony. A balcony! What a blessing. We spent every evening there taking advantage of the warm weather in October.All the staff with whom we interacted were very nice. When we could not turn on the TV and we called, they sent someone right away - turned out there was a switch on the wall you had to turn on first.The only slight drawback is that the bathroom itself is a bit tight but it's a very minor complaint considering acres of space in the suite.We love Washington and visit every year. We will be staying only at this hotel from here on in.Considering this is a 3 star hotel I actually found it to be much better than some 4 star hotels we have stayed. The rooms are huge, full kitchen, 1 and 1/2 bathroom and a great view from a huge balcony overlooking the circle. Try finding all this for the deal we got in DC, go ahead I will wait. It's ideal for a business trip or a family. We traveled the 4 of us for my husband's business trip. The location is perfect. Very ideal about 40 min walk to National mall, 20 from Vietnam memorial. Everything is relatively close. If you're a light sleeper it might not be ideal as there is a hospital, but it was fine for my toddler and infant. The one complaint I have is bothering people and having to use this service elevator thing to get outside each time with the stroller. It also makes it a little difficult if there are others with strollers or scooters or wheelchairs. A ramp might be a bit more ideal in this instance??? Also no automatic doors and there isn't always someone there to open the door for you. We only had the circle bistro (restaurant) for breakfast twice and it was pretty good. The beds are very comfy. It's basically a home away from home. Worked for us well."

The hotel provides a great value for the location and price. With that being said, the rooms could use some updating - the kitchens were pretty dated and the bathroom felt cramped. The pool was nice but the deck could also use a little TLC. The view of Washington Circle was spectacular from our balcony on the 8th floor, however. The customer service was excellent - I arrived early and they were very gracious in letting me store my bags before check-in and arranging other logistics of the stay. Always very polite. Overall a good solid hotel that provides excellent value for a convenient location in the West End, situated between Georgetown and Dupont Circle."

I stayed one night with my daughter and was so sorry I didn’t book another night. When we first arrived they offered me a complimentary glass of wine. Then we went to our room and sat on our balcony overlooking the beautiful pool and listened to some great jazz music. Our room had a kitchen so we were able to cook our breakfast there and eat on the porch. The weather was gorgeous which made it even better. The bed was crazy comfortable and I was very sorry to have to leave early. I really should have booked another night. The price was cheaper than almost any of the other hotels I looked at. The staff was friendly and accommodating. If you pay for valet parking ahead of time it’s very cheap. You have access to your car as many times as you want. I can’t wait to visit my daughter and stay there again!

This was our first visit to this property, and after numerous visits to the Capital City, it would be difficult to find as much bang for the buck anywhere else. While there are some things we didn't like, overall this is a fantastic place to stay. Things we liked:Location, location, location. This is two blocks from the Foggy Bottom Metro Station, and within two blocks of three Zipcar outlets. You can't really do better than this for transportation. You're right off the GWU campus, and minutes away from anything in DC that's on the Metro. There are several great casual eating places within a half mile, in addition to the hotel restaurant. The staff at this hotel knows they are competing with the big chains, so I think they make a bigger effort to make up for that with exemplary level service and friendliness. Accommodations are very good for the price. This property isn't new, and could use a bit of sprucing up. But the rooms were comfortable, the linens soft, the bed was as good as what we have at home, and wr had more than enough space. We were in Room 403, which had a king bed, a sofa bed, a small kitchen, dining room, and a balcony overlooking the pool. The walk in closet was larger than my master closet at home. Maid service was excellent, and she was finished with the room before lunch. My only criticism is that the bathroom is small. However the hotel provides soaps, gels, and shampoos that rival the big chains. The kitchen is equipped with dishes and basic cooking utensils, a fridge, stove, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. They even include a coffee grinder and fresh beans. For quick snacks, this hotel is two blocks from a Trader Joe's and a Whole Foods.We didn't use the pool, so I won't comment on it, but there is a patio overlooking the pool, and there is a guest laundry in the basement. The restaurant and bar is small, but provides great meals and cocktails. I would like to point out that the front desk was able to print out our museum tickets quickly. They also arranged our early morning airport transportation. Things I didn't like: this is across the circle from GWU Hospital, so ambulances came in at all hours. But we got used to it.Overall: this is our go-to place when we visit DC. The staff here helped make our visit very enjoyable."

We found the place to be clean and the staff helpful and attentive. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from the Foggy Bottom metro and a short 15 minute walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The area around the hotel had some great cafes and restaurants. We would definitely stay there again!"

But I didn't know anyone who has stayed at the hotel, so I took a risk while back for a business trip. Desk staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. The hotel is directly on Washington Circle with a drive through covered entrance. I believe this was once an apartment building, so many of the rooms are suites. I booked through hotels.com and got a very good deal for a popular time in the city. I was upgraded to a large suite on the 9th floor (#905) with a huge bedroom with balcony. The layout was quirky to say the least. You enter a large foyer with a small closet, a full kitchen to the left with stove, refrigerator, microwave, but no dishwasher. From the foyer was a large walk-in closet that contained the bathroom sink, off of which was a tiny room with bathtub and toilet. This was nearly a deal-breaker: this room was so small that the shower curtain hung over your head when you sat on the toilet, and you needed to close the door in order to reach the toilet paper holder. Neither this tiny room, nor the large closet from which you entered it, nor the kitchen contained windows, so that end of the suite is very dark and claustrophobic. The main room, itself, was huge--I assume that as an apartment, it formerly accommodated living, dining and bedroom space. If they ever renovate, they could make much better use of the space overall. The large balcony overlooked a very nice-looking ground-level pool and lounge area. One warning: George Washington University Hospital is directly across the circle, so there is ambulance noise throughout the day and night. If you are a light sleeper (and I am not), know that sirens from motorcades also abound in this neighborhood, as it is en route to and from the White House, State Department and other government agencies. And as I experienced last DC trip when I stayed at the Embassy Row Hotel, both places were designed at a time when handicapped accessibility was not a concern; both places require you to walk up steps from the entrance to check-in with only a small, retrofitted luggage/wheelchair elevator off to the side. I would likely stay here again. I'm curious if the other units are less quirky than what I experienced."

Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The daily rate was ""reasonable"" for the DC area except for $42 a day for parking which I know it's a city and space is at a premium. We didn't hear any noise from inside the hotel (except the rather loud and rattling heating/AC unit), however, there is a fire department behind hotel and hospital in front so sirens go pretty much go all day and night. We got used to it. Restaurant is not open on the weekends except for breakfast which was kind of a bummer. And beware if you book online: $20 breakfast offered is yogurt, fruit and croissant for 1 person when you could purchase an omelet with potatoes and toast for $12 in the same restaurant. Not sure why anyone would pay $20 for a continental breakfast. Thought it was kind of deceptive but after the first day, I asked the front desk to take it off our bill; and they did so without question. Convenient location: only 1 block from Metro station or you could walk to the National Mall in a little over a mile. To the back of the hotel, a few blocks away are several good restaurants that served all 3 meals at reasonable prices. George Washington University is steps away so there is a very vibrant feel to the area."

It was just so-so and here's why:Pros: 1) Location!!!! Perfect to walk to all the sights/monuments etc. We have a two year old and she even did fantastic on the walking distance. 2) Places to eat nearby! 3) They have complementary wine daily from 5-6!... 4). Beds were super comfy and plush.. 5) Full kitchen! Cons: 1) We had a leak in our ceiling in the bathroom coming from the room above us! We called front desk and the male who answered ( I'll leave his name out) sounded like he didn't care nor offered anything to compensate for their issue. Maintenance came and said it's coming from above but couldn't check it until the people above us checked out. In the end they ""said it was fixed"" but you could still see the rip in the ceiling. 2) Nice lobby, but rooms were somewhat outdated. 3) No onsite parking and they only offer valet for $42 nightly! Would I stay here again... Yes only due to location and if I were able to get the Groupon rate for a stay which is what we used this time"

Great location and very nice rooms, staff is extra nice! Have stayed at other hotels in the area but this is our favorite.I've stayed at One Washington Circle twice now, and I think it'll be my go-to hotel when I'm in DC. This time, I was in town with my mom for a Girls Trip - we had a King Room with a Wet Bar, as we wanted space more than we needed a full kitchen (the fridge was all we really needed). The location is perfect - it's a quick walk to the Metro Station at Foggy Bottom (just across the circle, and down half a block) and right on a bus line into Georgetown (on my previous stay, we walked to the White House). The surrounding area feels safe, most likely due GWU Hospital being located across the circle. The staff was also very helpful - they checked us in early to our room; gave us breakfast recommendations each day (in a variety of price categories); brought us extra towels; and most importantly, got the party in another suite on our floor to shut up within 5 minutes of us calling the front desk.The only negatives - due to the close proximity of GWU Hospital, sirens are pretty much a constant sound, so if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Also, you need to go up about four steps to get from the door to the front desk...staff was always there to help when we were there, but I don't know if that's always the case."

One of the main reasons for choosing this hotel was its close proximity to the Foggy Bottom Metro station and the good restaurants within the nearby Golden Triangle. Our room was a good deal larger than most that I have stayed in and had a small kitchen as well. Plenty of fresh coffee beans for us to grind each morning for a very fresh cup of strong coffee to get you going. The bedroom has a free to use safe, which was a nice touch. The small outdoor pool had a lifeguard on duty during opening hours and a nice sun deck to go with it. A friend of mind dropped by and was able to park his car in the forecourt, not something that every hotel could offer. We had a late flight to catch and the hotel was happy to look after our luggage while we spent our last day looking around 'The District' as the locals like to call it. We got back and treated ourselves to a cold beer and listened to a free Jazz duo who entertained us on the sun lounge before heading home."

The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, offered us umbrellas in the rain, and chatted up our kids as we would come and go throughout the day. The location is very close to Foggybottom Metro station – which was awesome! The room was not ""fancy"", but very clean, EXTREMELY spacious (great to spread out with 3 kids) & had comfy beds. It was the perfect retreat after a long day of sightseeing. Every room has a kitchen area (since the hotel use to be an apartment building) and that was perfect because we like keeping grab and go snacks and drinks on hand for the kids. CVS & WholeFoods is in walking distance but the hotel also offers a grocery delivery service with reasonable prices too. Our room had 1.5 baths and a huge balcony with a park view. The one things to be aware of is that it is near a hospital and so if you are a light sleeper, there is a chance you will occasionally hear an ambulance. We sleep like logs so that was not a problem for us– haha"

I managed to get a great rate via booking.com, and ended up with an Executive King Suite.I got an Uber from Dulles airport to the hotel (around $35), and was warmly welcomed by the receptionist. I was told that there were numerous restaurants and bars within walking distance, and if I needed any suggestions or directions just to ask. My room was great - a huge space with a separate kitchen, living room, dining room, bedroom and bathroom - this was far far bigger than anything I've seen in Europe. Overall, the room was very clean although could do with some cosmetic updates - some of the carpets and furniture were worn, and the kitchen seemed old fashioned (very clean though!).Location wise, the hotel was great - about 5mins walk from the nearest Metro station (Foggy Bottom GWU), and I'd recommend this as a good way to get around town. The area in which the hotel is situated seemed very safe, and had plenty of nice places to eat and drink.So, the price was great, the room was great, the service was great and the location was great.

First, it is across the circle from the GW emergency room so there are sirens all night long. But second, and most frustrating for me is that the bedrooms do not have black out shades. Instead they have blinds that are not flush with the wall so I woke up as soon as the sun was up every day as the sun comes in around the shades. The below photo is my bedroom at 6:30 am.

This hotel is always my #1 option to stay at D.C.Couldn't ask for more a convenient location, centered right in the heart of DC, you won't like it if you mind the sound of police cars or ambulance bc there's a hospital across the street, but they do offer white noise machines, it did not bother us - just sounded like the city and was faint, great location, close to all major museums and restaurants and more, super friendly staff, we were even given a complimentary mini-tour of our room and the view from our balcony (which was amazing and overlooked the city), our room was upgraded at no charge bc it was available, they parked our car by valet ($25) in the morning when check-in wasn't until 3 (or earlier if available), late check-out at noon, room service, room was very clean, some parts need updating but overall the decor and furniture and carpet were modern and attractive, bed was very comfortable, definitely recommend if you plan on touring the city for a day or two!"

The staff are courteous, friendly and helpful. The hotel is just in front of a metro station, so travelling is a breeze. My favorite things were the spacious, clean, inviting rooms with a personal balcony, and a kitchenette that let me have meals whenever I wanted. The prices are reasonable for the area, especially considering the handy amenities.Would love to stay here again."

I was greeted by a very friendly desk clerk, I don't recall his name but extremely nice and helpful. The room is very spacious, clean and has a kitchen fully stocked if you wanted to cook. The bed is wonderfully comfortable I slept very well, and I heard no noise from the nearby hospital, once you closed the balcony doors you heard very little.I did eat a lot of room service during my stay all the food from City Circle Restaurant was delightful and filling.All staff that I encountered throughout the hotel were very nice, smiling and always friendly. I highly recommend this hotel, don't be put off by the not so modern exterior, it's also a great hotel with the Hop on Hop off buses stopping right outside.I am checking out tomorrow and will definitely look at this hotel again if I visit Washington DC in the future. Also the WiFi is super fast.Well done One Washington Circle Hotel most impressive :)we were moved here from the sister hotel and we were delighted . We had a suite , which was spacious and clean with a balcony. The traffic was noisy but you couldn't hear it when the door was shut on the balcony.

You may have to wait on the street for a few minutes if others are checking in at the same time. They can accommodate about 5 cars near the front door. The staff is very polite and helpful. The hotel is within walking distance to the White House, Georgetown, and the mall with the memorials. Its about a mile to the Lincoln memorial I believe. I would stay here again."

The hotel was easy to find, and the valet parking was a nice feature in a busy city. Everyone from front desk staff and parking attendants to restaurant staff were very friendly. The location was great for us - directly at stop #36 on the Yellow Line for the Big Bus hop-on/hop-off bus. It was also close to many restaurants and convenience/drug stores.Although not the most up-to-date furnishings, the rooms were spacious and we loved having a kitchen to use! We purchased some breakfast supplies before arriving and it was great to take our time eating while getting ready in the mornings.The pool and patio area were a nice escape from the busy pace of the city, the morning coffee and fruit in the lobby (which is modern and smelled the best of any lobby I've ever been to), were a nice perk on our way out in the mornings. Coming back from a busy day to strawberry or lemon-infused water was also really appreciated.Some room for imrpovement:- more options for hanging wet towels- patio chairs on balconyOther that that, we will definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to family and friends!"

In my first night, there was a huge fly (the ugly big noisy type) couldn't understand how and from where did it come from. It took me 45 minutes to get it out. In my second night (Thank God) there was a huge insect!!! (pictures attached) for this one, I just slept and wished the morning comes so I check out! Seriously I've never experienced this in my whole life, I even stayed in motels that didn't have these insects! And when inreported to the reception, all I got was (I'm sorry that is weird)! Another issue was with the service, I had three bags and I called for Uber to pick me up, the poor uber guy was old and lifting the bag wasn't easy, the concierge guy at the hotel stayed there just staring at him!!!!

It had a full kitchen with fridge, stove, microwave and dishwasher. Trader Joe's and a huge Whole Foods were close by making it super easy to grab a few things to make breakfasts, snacks and even a picnic lunch right there in our room. This was so useful since we were traveling with young kids. What truly makes One Washington Circle a wonderful choice is the staff. Everyone from the greeters to the bell hops to the front desk and even the maid service did anything they could to ensure we had a pleasant stay.The fresh apples and refreshing fruit infused waters laid out midday and the wine served in the early evenings were also nice touches.I would not hesitate staying at this hotel again or recommending it to a friend."

The rooms were spacious, beds and bedding super comfy and staff friendly and accommodating. Restaurant was typical DC overpriced, but the food was reallygood and there was plenty of selection. We will definitely return!Was here for a conference late January and was stuck here in the 2016 blizzard. The hotel appears to be an old apartment complex. My room was a suite with a full kitchen, den and separate bedroom. Though older, the suite was clean with furniture in good shape. The kitchen appliances and cabinets are dated, but the bathroom is nicely updated. The hotel has a restaurant in the basement, the Circle Bistro, which isn't bad. As with any hotel restaurant in DC, prices are a little high but there are options in the lower cost range. The restaurant even stayed open during the blizzard when everything else closed. In the evenings during the week from 5-6pm, the hotel offers free appetizers and wine from the restaurant. Didn't try the appetizers, but the wine was nice after being in conference all day. There are also several restaurants which are a quick walk across the circle, as well as a Starbucks one block away. The Foggy Bottom Metro station is also within easy walking distance for the blue and yellow lines, very convenient to Reagan National Airport. Hotel is close proximity to George Washington University and the nightlife offered in this area. Be aware that the George Washington University Hospital is across the street-lots of sirens at night. Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful in extending my stay during the blizzard. They do offer self service laundry-which to purchase detergent and do one load cost $5. Very convenient for extended stays. One complaint is the conference space-it left much to be desired. It is the only one in the hotel, is rather small and is located in the basement. It met our basic needs, but it was certainly tight. If you are looking to plan a conference, use this hotel for guests and schedule the meeting space elsewhere-maybe the university? All in all, it's a great place to stay, especially for extended visits. I'd stay here again."

Tons of restaurants, coffee shops & bars nearby. Trader Joe's a few blocks away if you've chosen a room with kitchen facilities. Bed was very comfortable, desk with lamp for working. Only one chair for sitting in our King bed with kitchen suite. Plenty of space overall, basic dishes and supplies in the kitchen. Extra towels and supplies stocked below sink in bathroom. Lots of heavy wood hangers in closet. Delivered ice from restaurant upon request. Ambulances were noisy as mentioned. Hotel is owned by George Washington U and employs Hospitality students so the front desk vibe is energetic, enthusiastic and young. Guests include GWU visiting faculty and scholars so the hotel has a very global feel. As mentioned, the carpeting is way overdue for replacement. If you can get past that, this is an excellent option, we would stay again.I stayed during Christmas and it was wonderful. The staff is friendly & helpful, the food at the bistro is pretty good. This place is close to a metro stop and walkable (if you enjoy hiking) to the attractions in the city. Very close to Georgetown and the neighborhood is nice, however be weary at night because there's a bit of homeless people who like to hang out at the park across the street at night & the rats come out too. But the park was easy to let my pup go out and do her business. Having a mini kitchen in the room was an added plus. I'd return to this location in the future."

Large eating area, Desk for computer, patio and full stocked kitchen. You could save some money by cooking in. Good location. Cons:Carpet could use replacing. Couch was a sleeper, so it was not comfortable. Noise could be an issue for some people. Odd TV—digital I think, which meant channel surfing was out of the question, each channel had to load."

I would have to say, they missed their mark here. I had an ample one bedroom suite with living room, kitchenette and bathroom. The room itself was worn. Much needs to be done to stained carpeting, spackled walls and everyday wear and tear. (I will provide photos). The staff was very nice, not out of their way helpful, but nice.

Loved Emanuel who is the gentleman who helps you enter the hotel. Julian who is the young guy at the front desk was so great to us. We were sad when we left, we will miss Emanuel, he certainly aims to please and such a genuine person. I gave him a great big hug when we left. One Circle, please pass on our gratitude to Emanuel and Julian, we stayed June 17-20 in room 319.Pros:Lovely location, 20 min walk to White house.Best staffing around, Emanuel greeted us, took all our things up to our room, put them away (kitchen items) and gave us an informative tour and asked if the room was to our standards. Great introduction Emanuel.GREAT staffing.Bedding, new beds, new linens, comfy pillows.Sink outside of toilet and shower, awesome feature.Full service kitchen with stove, fridge, coffee maker, toaster, and plates/silverwareGo shopping at Trader Joes few blocks away, we made our own breakfast every morning.Balcony - such a plus, at first we had no chairs, requested by they could not find any, Emanuel searched high and low and got us chairs, one of the best features of this hotel was sitting on the balcony in the morning with coffee or evening to people watch.Pool - lovely and a sitting area reminded me of the beach.Gym - small but updated equipmentTV- nice large modern flat screen that rotates.Location - great in the circle with park across street.Commutes - cannot comment, we use UBER, we love UBER, we do not use trolleys or metro or buses, save your money and time and look into UBER, especially if you have never signed up, you get a bunch of free rides, these drivers pick you up wherever you want, there within minutes, take you exactly where you want to go for very little money. WE took Ubers everywhere, forget about waiting for metro that is hot and over crowed (like for the nationals game), we took Uber, there (Nationals Park) in 20 min, picked us up to go back 20 min, total cost round trip $13 for four people in the car, best way around D.C.One Stop trolley or Bus Tours - in our opinion don't do it. It sounds amazing and all but for $35 pp for one day........it was an unusual above 90 degrees each day we were there. We saw very little trolleys, and they trolley stops we did see, the line to get on was terrible, when one finally came, it was full and you had to WAIT for yet another one. Checkk out Tripadvisor for One Trolley Stop and you'll see for yourself, Now I'm not against it, but it just wasn't for US, and I like to make my reviews as informative as possible.White House - you can walk will, take 20 min, seems longer though, we took Uber, it was a $5 trip to get 4 of us in the car!Lincoln Memorial - again you can WALK anywhere IF you want to, that walk took up about 45- 50 minutes, we hadn't planned on walking it, just worked out that way.Eats - we ate at Bobby Burger place, Five Guys, had Dominos delivered (2x) and food trucks and what not, we traveled as a family of 4 so kept it simple, We hear Founders Farmer is good, but tried to make reservation but was full for the night.MUST SEE -per Emanuel request, see the Lincoln Memorial at night, it was amazing!CONSOr maybe I should say suggestions.Kitchen area, no table or seating, lots of room there, could have a small tableCarpet - gross and outdated, really needs replacedShower - moldy, really needs updated, shower head almost uselessCurtains - sorry OWCH they were just so gross and filthy, please replace themBalcony - such a great feature, place some inexpensive chairs on ALL balconies, not so many guests would have been as persistent as myself, and its a great feature.Guest Shop - there is NOT one, not that I found, to buy like candy and little items.TV- why so much in and out of channels, one minute works, next it does not?Ambulance and firetrucks - nothing the hotel can do about this, you are right next to the University Hospital and you hear these blazing sirens ALL DAY long, it didn't bother us, or keep us up at night, but just an observation.Overall stay was so great! Staffing really makes this hotel, the size of the room is roomy but needs some real updates. Kitchen is such a money saving feature!!! Would I come back? Yes Yes Yes, you will be pleased with this hotel. Please tell Emanuel and Julian HELLO, they will treat you like family."

We wanted to see the monuments, the museums, the riverfront and the shops in Georgetown and “One Wash” (as the locals call it) turned out to be the most centralized location to call home during our stay. But the experience made all the difference!From the bellman to the front desk manager, every employee made us feel like we were coming home each time we walked through the front door. We even brought our dog—who received the same pampered attention (treats, dog bowls, doggy bags, etc!)

The hotel was relatively easy to get to from the Union Station by metro, although it does require either a 10 minute walk or a line change.Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted warmly by the reception staff, and given a room on the second floor - a slight shame as we were hoping for more of a view. When we walked in we were blown away - the suite was huge. There were tons of lovely finishing touches, including fresh coffee beans and a grinder and magazines about the local area. What impressed us most was the enormous soft bed. The shower was powerful and hot. There was a balcony but we didn't venture out in the cold.I don't think the hotel is far from the various tourist attractions, but it was cold and rainy so the fact that it was only a minute's walk from the nearest Metro stop (Foggy Bottom) was brilliant. There were also a lot of options for dining out in the area - we felt a little spoilt for choice!We ordered room service the first night, and although it was probably a little more than we'd budgeted for (~$100 for two mains, a dessert, a glass of wine and a bottle of beer) the quality of the food made it completely worth it - it was like a fine dining restaurant in the comfort of our room. The second night we ate out, and on the way back decided to buy a bottle of wine from the bar. Even though the bar had already shut, the bartender was kind enough to sell us a bottle anyway.The one small negative was that the TV remote was a bit dodgy, but being British we didn't want to bother the hotel staff with such a silly problem, so we made do. There is also quite a lot of siren noise, but compared to NYC we barely noticed it at night.Throughout the visit the staff were friendly and chatty, and accommodated all our requests including baggage storage so we could visit another museum on our last day. The cost of the room was incredibly good for the level of comfort and service you got. I'd definitely recommend One Washington Circle Hotel to anyone visiting DC, and will hopefully stay there again in the future."

A special thanks to Naara, Kat and Jackie who made the arrangements and wrote us a lovely congratulatory letter which we will keep as a reminder of our great experience. The facilities were very clean and comfortable and the location was great. We were able to walk just about everywhere in the city. I would highly recommend this hotel based on the service alone.

Having spent 25 hrs on the flight, we really appreciate the front desk for allowing us to check in earlier (11am). The check-in process was quick and efficient. We booked an executive one bedroom king suite. Our suite was very spacious, featuring a kitchen, dining and living room separated from the bedroom, and a balcony. The bed was very comfortable. The wifi was free, and we are happy with the connection throughout our stay. Our room was at the intersection of L street and 23rd St. It was actually very quiet at night; and in daytime, the noise from the ambulance was quite bearable. We especially like the coin-operated, self service washer and dryer provided at the basement. It cost USD2 per wash and it was easy to operate. You can change coin at the front desk or at the bistro. The hotel is 5-min walk from the Foggy Bottom metro station and the Whole Food Market. It is a 20-min walk to the White House.We booked a room with breakfast included. The down side is we can only choose between 1) continental breakfast (with rolls) and 2) egg, and sausage. We got bored after 2 days. We requested to change our breakfast to some other things in the menu which is of lower price, but we were told that we can't change. I regretted paying extra for a room which included breakfast. Furthermore, the serving for the breakfast was inconsistent- sometimes I get 2 slices of bread, sometimes I get 1. On 2 different days, I found used jam and opened sugar packs being placed back into the rack. That showed that the staffs did a half-baked job!As for my room, I wish the bathroom is more brightly lit, as there was no light in the bath cubical. And, it'll be better if slippers are provided so that we can enjoy sitting at the balcony without getting our feet dirty. There were coffee machine provided at the kitchen but the coffee bean was unground. It will be good if the hotel could provide some ground coffee powder cos it'll save us so much time.Overall, this is a good hotel, and I'll stay here again."

Great Accommodation!! Courteous Staff!!!,"I was originally going to stay in VA, but when I found out that the cost of a one-way Metro train ticket was $3.95 per person each way, I quickly changed my mind and chose to stay in the capital in order to be within walking distance to all of the DC sites.Arjun, in Reservations, was the most courteous and accommodating. I had tons of questions and he was always quick to help get them answered. And, the ladies at the reception desk were the sweetest and most courteous ever.The room (1 King bedroom suite) had a large balcony, a full kitchen (equipped with dishes and kitchen tools, 4-burner stove with oven, and a dishwasher), and one and one-half bathrooms - so convenient for four people. When you're on vacation, you don't want to have to do dishes even though there was a dishwasher. So, to make it even more accommodating, housekeeping would handle it.To add to the convenience, there was a rain storm one night, so we didn't want to venture out. Hence, we dined at the on-site restaurant on the lower level. I see why it was rated as one of the top 100 in the DC metro area...the food was superb.This hotel also has a pool (not many in DC do) as well as beautiful views of Foggy Bottom - from the balcony - and, valet parking (we drove).I can't say enough about this trip and my stay at the One Washington Circle Hotel for the 4th of July weekend, other than...""I'll Be Back!"""

I thought the pictures from the website made this hotel look pretty posh. But it's not, the decor is dated and the carpet worn and not very clean. There were even loose tiles in the shower. The shape of the room was odd and made me think this used to be housing for the university. We had a nice balcony but there was no furniture on it so we really didn't use it. And its really noisy, I live in a smallish town but only a few blocks from a fire station so I thought the ambulance noise wouldn't bother me too much. I was wrong. We were on the 9th floor and the sirens went off all day and night. The first night we were there was during Rolling Thunder and between the Harleys and the sirens I was thinking we wouldn't even make it the week. Fortunately things did settle down, but the sirens were a big deal for us. The staff was always very friendly and helpful, they even let us borrow an umbrella one day."

Big rooms, amazingly friendly staff (which goes a long way in my book), and for a bonus...Circle Bistro, one of DC's top-rated restaurants. We were in town for the annual spring Cherry Blossom festival. Big crowds? No problem...the hotel is situated right between two Metro stations (Foggy Bottom & Farragut North) which gave us easy access to the entire city. We walked/metro'd everywhere...never took a cab. As a frequent business traveler, I took note of the business center and great wifi network. I will definitely recommend the One Washington Circle Hotel to any biz associates coming to town.

None of them were true. We arrived at the hotel at 530pm, our room was not ready but was offered another room which we didn't take. Gentleman rushed our room, but told us that the carpet was still wet, we said its OK. Checked into the room, it has a funny odor, and there were mosquitoes.

There were just a few negatives but overall it was a great experience. The room was pretty spacious with a full kitchen, large refrigerator, stove and cabinets. We had the room with a balcony with a view of the street and pool area. It was quite nice other than the loud noise from the ambulance since we were close to the hospital, but that was expected before booking this hotel. The hotel itself was charming but somewhat average, it was nice, very clean and most importantly in a great location to many of the hot spots. This was our first time driving in the DC area and I thought the streets were very dangerous and crowded in the area. When we drove into the lobby driveway to check in it was a bit of a challenge for us and they parked the car in a small area by the dumpster area at the hotel since parking was very limited it seems. Also, the cost for parking was around 35 dollars a day. Other than those negatives that I've mentioned, the hotel was worth the stay, the staff was friendly and attentive and the room and balcony was lovely. The hotel is walking distance to the metro train and many restaurants. We had free internet and had no issues."

The kitchen was really very spacious too! It came equipped with a full 2-door fridge (old, but in excellent working condition), a 4-hob gas stove (and oven!), pots/pans/utensils and enough diningware for 2 people. The hotel also provides your room with percolators, coffee beans & a coffee grinder, so you can make your own fresh coffee in-room!The beds here are quite comfortable, with medium-firm mattresses. However, for best sleep quality, do ask for a room that faces away from the circle.

The pool was clean and needed in the heat, there was also a lifeguard on duty (which was reassuring when traveling with a small child).

My ONLY complaint was that I wasted money on ear plugs. Yes DC has a very active EMS system, and yes you are across from the hospital, but we very rarely heard any sirens after sundown. Also 99% of the sirens were responding to calls not transporting to the hospital. My point is, you'd likely hear the same amount of sirens regardless of where you are. PLEASE don't let the fear of noise deter you from choosing to stay in this wonderful hotel. It's not a glamorous hotel, it's a business hotel. It couldn't have been better for us. Spacious, clean, and a full kitchen. Trader Joe's was a couple blocks away and a large CVS was behind the hotel. It's in a great neighborhood too. We saved a fortune by preparing our own meals a few times. And the refreshing citrus water provided to guests in the lobby was a special treat when returning from a long day of sightseeing. We couldn't have been happier with this hotel. Wish we could have stayed even longer."

The location was so good. We are a family who enjoy walking, so we walked everywhere from this hotel. It was about a 10-15 minute walk to the Lincoln Memorial in one direction, and the about the same time straight down Penn Ave. to the White House. In another direction from the circle, you could walk to the Kennedy Center for the performing arts in less than 10 minutes. And in another direction from the Circle, Georgetown shopping and restaurants was about 10 minutes walk. They are working on upgrading the elevators, so only one was in operation, which made for a wait sometimes. But the kids (and us occaionally) took the stairs (9 flights) all the time!! We walked all day visiting the museums, buildings, memorials and other sites. We took the Metro back one day because we were just so tired. We took it to the Foggy Bottom stop which came up right beside the George Washington University Hospital, which was across the circle in front of the hotel - very convenient!!We drove down and weren't able to negotiate complimentary parking for our stay ($30/day). We parked the car for a day or two at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, 1 block away for $25 per day, and then we found another safe place to park the car close by, which was way cheaper than the the Ritz or our hotel. We used it to go out to the Space Museum (not to be missed) out by Dulles Airport, which with 5 of us was a considerable saving for the shuttle service offered from downtown.Having the little kitchen in our hotel suite was great. Trader Joes was 2 blocks over (about 5 minutes) and we could get lots of great healthy groceries there. It was a busy place, with lots of selection. It's a bit pricier than suburban grocery stores, but it's still a lot cheaper (and healthier) than eating out with the family every day. They also sell wine there. We got great bread, buns, coldcuts, cheeses and fruit to make our ""picnic"" lunches every day. No one wanted to go out for dinner - too tired, so we made meals each night. The kitchen had a full gas stove with oven, large fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, and even a coffee grinder!! It also had a garburator. The kitchen was cleaned completely everyday, although we did the dishes and tidied up before. The cooking utensils were minimal, but sufficient and we had to be a bit creative with what we had. We asked for some more plates and cutlery and they were brought up immediately. We also needed a baking sheet to warm some things up, so we were able to get one from the Circle Bistro, which was great. A couple of bowls to make a salad in, or put snacks/fruit in, and some mixing bowls and perhaps a glass baking dish might be useful, as well as a microwaveable dish. A dish rack would have also been a nice touch!We had a one bedroom suite. The furnishings are modern, middle of the road - not totally upscale, not cheap. There were 2 flat screen TVs, and there was a balcony. The pool is an outdoor pool and was closed at the time. The room was extremely clean and was cleaned wonderfully every day. The bathroom was pretty small and there was no fan. But everything you needed was there (with extra supplies) and it was cleaned up every day; it was modern and compact and it was extremely clean (no mold or gross corners) and well lit - just no room to hang 5 towels to dry!!2 of our kids slept on the pull out couch in the living room, and didn't complain. We brought a compact cot for the other. They only complained the first night about the sirens. In the following days, we were all too exhausted from the day to be bothered by anything at night!! There is a police station behind the hotel, and the hospital is across the circle from the hotel. But I will say, that the sliding doors were really not soundproof at all. We always thought we had left the doors open, but they are just not really great quality doors for dampening outside noise. A pair of ear plugs works absolute wonders if you are more affected by noise at night!!The beds and bedding were very clean and the bed was very comfortable, as were the pillows. There was a safe in the large front hall closet which you could set up a code for and wireless internet service worked perfectly.Our experience with the staff at this hotel was a very positive one. They were very friendly and extremely helpful when we had questions for them. They promptly brought us anything that we were missing (kitchen items, extra pillows, etc.) They interacted with our children and the kids loved that sense of familiarity. They hailed cabs for our friends to go back to their hotel. They were disappointed that they weren't able to get a reservation in this hotel as well. We also loved the complimentary water with lemon and lime slices in it located in the lobby!Because it is so well priced for what you get compared to other accomodations downtown, it fills up fast. So book early, as prices nearly doubled there as it got to within 10 days of our arrival. It's quite popular with Europeans and with families because of it's proximity and price point, and having the little kitchen is great with children along.Overall, we had a great experience at this hotel and would definitely go back in a heartbeat. It's not the Ritz, but it's not meant to be. It is friendly, clean, fairly modern, bed-bug free, and it's all about the LOCATION!!"

Price was very low (104 with AAA) but it is winter. Rooms were huge-walk in closet, queen bed, living room area and kitchen. I liked the shampoo/conditioner/soap pump in the shower, cute touch. As some mentioned you do hear sirens occasionally, I think i might have been woken up once or twice but not a huge deal for me. Certainly not something you hear the whole time. Staff was super friendly and always said hi and opened the doors for us. The only less than stellar thing is the location.. For sight seeing tourists like us (who make the mistake of going to cold cities in the winter:) ), its too far to walk in the cold to downtown/museums/places to eat. We took cabs everywhere we went which got a little pricey. Any other time of year would be fine though AND the cabs are affordable (and so much more friendly then the Boston cabs i'm used to). Honestly what you lose in proximity you gain in value( all the hotels i saw downtown were super fancy looking). Its about a 15-20 minute walk to downtown georgetown also which is cute and has restaurants and fancy shops. You can walk to the Lincoln monument also (15 minutes). Overall, a great stay!"

It's a one bedroom suite with a large living room, a dining room with 6 chairs, a kitchen, a large terrace overlooking the circle and a bath (plus a powder room).

Room was very clean with multiple towels and extra pillows more than we ever needed. We come down to DC from NY about 7-8 times a year and we will definitely stay here again. Regarding some noise concern, it did not bother us so much (it is an urban hotel in Washignton, D.C). If they keep their pricing reasonable, we will not look anywhere else."

The room service was superb and the rooms were huge and convenient. In sum, it is perfect for families and those who wish to stay long term.The hotel location is prime. It is one block from George Washington University and the Foggy Bottom GWU Metro station. A few more blocks south is the Lincoln Memorial. A few blocks down Pennsylvania Ave is the White House. The circle park/rotunda is surrounded by restaurants and shops if you ever need food or water. Though the park itself is full of sleepy vagrants, they don't bother you.The service was friendly and simple. The valet parking was speedy and our car was well taken care of. Housekeeping was immaculate and our last night of stay we were given chocolates! The rooms themselves are enormous: A long hallway to the bedroom/studio, a full kitchen with full-sized fridge, microwave, oven, stove and utensils. Even though our room was by the elevator, we had little noise at night. Hecklers who complain about traffic noise must have mouse ears because we heard no noise at night and little during rush hour mornings.The hotel is NOT for the spoiled and those who seek luxury. Furniture, carpeting and doors are a little outdated (EXCEPT for the big flat screen TV!). The bathroom was a little cramped and the closet a little tight. Living here was like staying overnight at a good friend's clean apartment. But, for the price of the hotel compared to large chain-operated ones, this one tops them in value. You get a kitchen, safe, huge TV and fast internet access; what more can I ask for? If you like being a nitpicky brat, go spend your well-earned money elsewhere that's far overpriced."

Positives: Large, clean room with full kitchen and separate bedroom. Convenient to Foggy Bottom Metro and Georgetown and Bus Stop. Very close to Starbucks, Bruegger's Bagels, Trader Joe's and other small take-out places. All of the staff that we dealt were friendly and helpful. The internet was free and worked fairly well except the morning it didn't work at all.Negatives: Sirens were very loud and frequent. Both L St and Washington Circle have a lot of traffic. The bed wasn't very firm. The stocking of bathroom was a bit odd. We had 2 or 3 bottles of conditioner and never got a bottle of shampoo. The kitchen was stocked with coffee beans and a coffee grinder, but I don't like the hassle of grinding the beans and I often drink decaf and the only decaf was instant. I would have preferred packets of both regular and decaf. I would recommend this hotel, but would warn them about the noise."

I found a deal throught Travelzoo, which included parking in the price (a plus). I arrived prior to check in time, but was allowed to check in and place my luggage in my room. I had reserved 2 beds in my room, and was surprised when there was on queen bed and a pull out sofa. After speaking to 2 staff members, I found out that although I requested 2 full beds, they can only guarantee 2 beds will be in the room in the form of 2 full beds or a queen bed and sofa bed. There are only about 8 rooms with 2 full beds in the entire hotel, the rest are in the queen/sofabed layout. I do wish they had relayed that information when I booked...The rooms were large, this room style has a mini-fridge and microwave (not the full kitchen like I thought I was getting). Large closet, decent size bathroom. 2 balconies. Noise was not an issue at all, and the decor in the hotel was very nice. I chose to not use the included parking (it was valet) because I was told it can take up to 30 min to get your car...and I'm the type that when I'm ready to go...I'm ready to go! Street parking was never an issue, so that is the path I took. Overall, a very nice stay and I would definitely stay here again!Spent 4 days at this hotel in mid-October with 2 teens. Room on the 9th floor with a full kitchen was perfect for our family. The hotel is not ""downtown"" but it's within a few minutes walking distance to both Georgetown and the Foggy Bottom Metro station so everything is accessible. Service was excellent, gym and pool were clean. Although I'd read on TA about the sirens (hospital's across the street), we weren't bothered by them. In any case, everyone seems to sit on their horn in DC. All in all, a great experience. Keep in mind that parking is $30/day, added on to your room fee."

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who desires a conveniently located hotel with great service. The rooms are much larger than the average hotel and include kitchens as well. While our room did not have the ""full"" kitchen, it was more than adequate for a brief stay. The room included a counter with coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. There was a large walk in closet near the bathroom as well as a chest of drawers in the bedroom. The hotel was very easy to find and also included all day/night in-out parking. We booked a package that included parking for free but even at $30 per night it's still a great deal. It was conveniently located near the GWU Metro station. The only negative which did not bother us at all was the proximity to the hospital/sirens. The whole facility was very clean and invitiing. 'We were able to walk to everything in a reasonable period of time from the hotel, especially Georgetown which was a great area for shopping/dining. As I mentioned earlier, I would most certainly recommend it and have no complaints whatsoever!!!!Just got back from my vacation and stayed at One Washington Circle Hotel..I arrived around 10am, so room is not ready, but they are willing to store by bags till i come back to check in. I really like my room, its quiet, clean, spacious with full kitchen and close to the Foggy Bottom Metro.. I also use a DC Circulator pass and its very accessible to different museums and other point of interests.. I like the aveda product that they provide in the room. love the free internet connection.."

It's a lovely little hotel and got a ton for a great price. We had the Corporate Suite on the top floor, we had a big living room, fold out couch, dining room, kitchen, huge balcony, small bathroom, large walk in closet and a comfy king sized bed! The maid service was great, we asked for extra towels and they brought us a huge bag full of goodies (towels, soaps, etc..) The pool was small and very cold, but nice. Be careful, because they don't tell you up front that parking is $30 a day. They lead you to believe it's included. But you can take the car in and out as many times as you'd like for no extra cost. The hotel is a short walk to Georgetown, I highly recommend that. It is extremely noisy at night. The hotel is smack in the middle of a police station and a hospital. So....loud sirens ALL night long. If you are a light sleeper, DO NOT stay here.The service was o.k. There usually wasn't anyone ever at the front desk, so no use in asking directions or suggestions. Check in and Check out was a breeze, but if you have an issue or some problem that is when it gets tricky. The room was amazing and location pretty good. So for the price I recommend it. Feel free to email me with any questions, I don't mind."

It's a local hotel owned by George Washington University.Hotel is above average, probably in the 3-star boutique category. There is nothing fancy about the property, and in fact, on first glance, the exterior looks a bit dated. However, don't let the outside detract you. Inside furnishings are fairly new. Silk duvet covers, nice bedding, Aveda toilettries. We had one of the smaller suites, but it was still more than enough room for the two of us. Suite included a sofabed, chair, work area, full-size kitchen, queen-size bed, walk-in closet. There is also free hi-speed internet access. I also could connect to a few open wi-fi networks in the area.Two potential downsides, bathroom is quite small with little to no counterspace (this is alleviated by a small bureau immediately outside the bath door) and as some of the previous reviews mentioned, the hotel is in close proximity to the University hospital. I'll have to say, after the first night, I didn't notice the sirens any more.Hotel is conveniently located in Foggy Bottom and about 2 blocks from the Blue / Orange Metro Line station. Georgetown is a close 10-15 minute walk down Pennsylvania (or you can take the DC Circulator, a limited-service bus for $1) and there are CVS and 7-Eleven stores located nearby for groceries.All in all, a great place to stay at a great value. We'll definitely stay there again in the future."

The pool water is very murky...maybe bc it’s too dirty?? There was no toilet paper in the pool bathroom and no one came to refill it even though we called the front desk and waited 2 hrs. There is no shower to rinse in the pool area even though the sign says to “shower before entering pool.” Both my sisters and I had rashes the next day after swimming in the pool. I recommend A full renovation of the pool area.The breakfast area was very small and I skipped breakfast all together for 3 days bc I didn’t want to deal with the crowd. The bathroom shower is interesting as you can see in the photo. This is an indication management does not pay attention to the quality of the hotel."

The room itself was a good size for one person (particularly in a large city like DC) and was clean/modern. The wi-fi was solid. The room was typical of other Hamptons I've stayed at in urban areas. I would definitely stay here again... just know that it's not a perfect location or anything exotic. It's a solid Hampton that will get you through your stay without an issue.

Showers didn't always have hot water, so be thoughtful when getting ready in the morning. Hotel is in very easy walking distance to the Verizon Center.

He said I booked through Expedia (it was actually another company) so I couldn't check in early. He didn't answer any of my questions, grunted, pointed and said go over there and come back later. There was a super sweet woman there who did end up answering my questions and said our room would be ready by 2:30. After the first rude man, all of the employees were wonderful. Parking is valet only and $42/day plus tax. The valets were nice and helpful. The hotel is clean and the elevators are fast. The fitness center was well equipped and clean.We had a 5th floor room and the traffic and sirens were very loud. There were people opening and closing doors all night. It was all very loud. It woke me up multiple times per night. The mattress is too firm for my taste. The national mall is a 25 minute walk. However the heat index was 106 while we were there, so we took Uber everywhere (Uber is the fastest, chespest, and most convenient way to get around DC). There are many restaurants in China town, which is a block away. The breakfast was better than average for a hotel breakfast. . It was very, very, busy and crowded and there is not enough seating. But, the staff did an excellent job of keeping it stocked. Coffee and hot chocolate are available in the lobby all day. They also had cold water infused with fruit for free. There is also a cafe/bar in lobby. The pool area was nice with lots of seating and a hot tub The pool was cool, which felt nice on a hot day. But, there was a very strong chlorine smell on both days that we used it. Everyone in the pool area was coughing and rubbing their eyes. We had to leave as my son was having trouble breathing the air and our eyes were burning. This seems to be quite a problem and I think they need to look into it. We kept missing the cookies that were put out in the evening. So, my husband and son asked when they were put out so we wouldn't miss them next time. A wonderful staff member named JC (sp?) said that they weren't being put out that day since it was the weekend. But, she checked with the manager and she was told that they could make a batch of cookies, just for our family! 1/2 hour later, we had delicious fresh baked chocolate chip cookies, just for us. This made us feel so very special and welcome! I would stay at this hotel again, but I would request a higher room. I did mention the noise from our room and I did ask for a higher floor. But, I was told the hotel was completely booked."

Pool room had a level of chlorine that melted your eyes upon entry, but other than that we didnt have any negatives during our stay. The only thing i noticed our room lacked were fans in the bathrooms. Not all hotels have them, so no biggie, but I find them to be a cool lil under the radar bonus when my family is in a hotel. No worries, i just used the lobby mens room each time the stank factory was in business. Room was clean. Breakfast was good enough for my family. We stayed here and walked to all the monuments and museums. We had 3 under 8 years old. We made it through 2 days, but the little ones were super pooped and the big ones were too. So walks to the major stuff doable, but not for the feint of heart. Ok, so pro tip #1 (this is the biggie) - this is in metropolitan D. C., so parking is going to be an issue. They will valet you on site for $42 overnight, but freakin a, who wants to do that? Especially if you're going to be there more than just overnight. There is a safeway grocery store right around the corner with an underground parking garage. I parked there and it was like a 1-2 minute walk. It cost me $36 for 2.5 days parking there and it would have cost me around $100 using the valet at the Hampton. Pro tip #2- we made the mistake or ordering take out chinese food from this place that had slipped their menu under our door. Somehow, mysteriously, I could not find them at all on tripadvisor to review them but it was NOT a good experience. The place is called Yum's. Their food was ok, but they promised prompt delivery and them promptly took 90 minutes to actually deliver it. Save yourself a headache and dont order from Yum's. Not sure how they even get into the hotel to wander around slipping their propaganda under every door unnoticed."

Not a super luxury hotel, but reasonably priced Would stay here again if had another event at the convention center and did't want to spend a fortune.Wanted to stay in DC to catch a Caps game. There are a few choices near the Verizon Center and the Hampton worked best for us in terms of price and location. About a 5 minute walk or so.Got parked and checked in easily. Room was perfect and had a great view toward the Verizon Center. The hotel appeared to be fairly full, but they were able to handle the free breakfast with ease. Typical choices for breakfast - solid, no frills food to start the day.Internet worked and there were no issues. Hotel bar was small but was fine for a post-game drink, even if a bit pricey. Bottom line - we'd look to return to this location when coming for a Caps game."

There are many restaurants and shops within walking distance and for spirited walkers, The White House and National Mall are about 20 minutes away. The hotel is clean and comfortable and offers happy hour and hot breakfast. The rooms are comfortable but a bit noisy de to the city location. Rooms have microwaves, a small fridge, coffee pot and iron/board. There is a fire station just a few blocks away and there must be a lot of fire calls near the hotel because there seemed to always be sirens sounding. The hotel has a pool and hot tub on the second floor and a small fitness room as well. Service was great and the staff was very personable. Rates were normal for DC and the hotel is close to the Metro (or a short cab ride from Reagan National Airport).Hampton Inn is generally our #1 choice so I am not writing about the breakfast and layout of the room. This choice was all about location. We wanted to stay in a neighborhood of DC that we had never explored before. We needed to be in an area of historic sites and museums for me. My husband needed a Metro stop, Gallery Place, a place to ditch the car, and decent room price. $42 /day parking was no where near the price we have paid in some cities.The valet at our arrival was efficient and cheerful even as he had to correct parking problems, haul luggage, and deal with frustrated and irritable travelers. He was a former Marine trained to deal with stress and the stressed. One negative I must mention is that there are the sirens of emergency vehicles all over this area day and night. We have no problem with noise, but if you do, you need to be aware of this. I felt safe walking alone in this neighborhood.The streets are full of others walking which is what I want, better a crowded street than a desserted one. We asked for a map and a list of restaurants and the desk had both. We walked to Ford's Theater, Anderson House, several small restaurants on 7th, plus Busboys and Poets and also Clydes. I spent a day at the Portrait Gallery and American Art Museum. Admission is free and the climate-controlled courtyard has a little cafe. We would recommend this Hampton Inn to our friends."

Definitely a great face for Hampton Inn. We instantly felt welcomed upon arrival.If you're traveling DC by foot, the hotel is a ~20-25 minute walk from the National Mall, and 5-10 minutes to Chinatown (and the Chinatown metro). There are a lot of neighboring restaurants around the area if you're looking to dine out. The Verizon Center is also within walking distance if you're in town for an event.Breakfast is served every morning. From cereal, oatmeal, waffles, and sausage. There's a selection for just about everyone. Coffee is always out in the lobby, and cookies are served at 5PM daily.Our overall stay was pleasant. The room was always clean. The staff was always willing to answer any question, and make sure everyone was enjoying their stay. The Wi-Fi signal is my only complaint. Aside from that, everything was great and I would definitely come back!"

There are many restaurants within a few blocks. Added bonus, there is a good size 24 hour grocery store called Safeway behind the hotel."

My room was clean and I have no complaints. I also went to the gym and it was more than adequate for me. The free weights and treadmills, seemed to be new, They also had an indoor pool and laundry facilities. I would definitely stay here when I go the DC for a vacation.

Their is coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the lobby 24 hours and bar area including outside seating if you need something a little stronger. I had the opportunity to interact with several of the staff members and they were incredibly helpful and friendly. Room was an average Hampton Inn room. Nothing special but clean with adequate space.

I booked our stay at the Hampton the same day and I am so very happy they had rooms for us, When we arrived, our room was not ready but they stored our bags for us so we could go out walking. The very nice valets took our car too. Our room was on the 8th floor and we had a nice very of town. The bed was very comfortable with feather like pillows and the room was nice and quiet. After dinner I look the kids downstairs to have a cup of tea in the lobby and it was so relaxing. It wasn't that long but it was just kind of fun. The hotel offers free coffee and tea throughout the day which was a nice touch. We came down for breakfast the next morning (which was included with the room). Even though there were lots of folks doing the same thing there was plenty of spaces to sit down and eat throughout the dining and lobby bar area. Initially we took a cab down to the Tidal Basin and Lincoln Memorial and then just walked back to the hotel visiting the Washington Monument on the way. The weather was a bit chilly but the walk was just the right amount of distance to be comfortable. The next day we walked to the Smithsonian Museums so I think the hotel is a pretty convenient location. There might be closer hotels but the walk is reasonable."

Our family will choose a Hampton Inn over anything else, but occasionally you find one that is not up to par. This was NOT the case here. This Hampton Inn is well taken care of, updated, clean, and excellent in every way possible. We had a King Studio and travelling with two very small children, this was a perfect room. It was very spacious, had a great open layout in order to keep our eye on the kids, and an excellent view of the city, including the Washington Monument. It even had a large counter space complete with sink, fridge and microwave, perfect for washing baby bottles, storing snacks, etc. Most importantly, it was QUIET!!! The hotel itself is in an excellent location. An easy 15-20 minute walk to all the museums and monuments. The neighborhoods you walk through were nice and we felt safe no matter the time of day or night walking through them. The staff at the valet and in the breakfast area were superb. It is the typical Hampton Inn breakfast, however, the staff does a great job in keeping it stocked and also is very friendly, especially to families with children. They brought my children coloring supplies every morning, and did not browbeat us when our table was left a little messier than let's say, an adults only table. We had zero issues with getting the wifi or TV to work in our room and we stayed on the top floor too. By far, one the best aspects of this hotel is the hotel manager, Jerry. He quickly addressed our concerns, made us feel extremely welcome, and continued to check on us throughout our stay. I will admit that I am rather picky about hotels but this one met all of my needs and did so in a way that made me feel both welcome and appreciated. We have already booked our next stay this summer. There really is no need to look at other hotels for your DC trip. If you want a clean, updated, smoke-free, quiet hotel in a perfect location with extremely attentive staff, this is the place for you. **Highly recommend Fuel Pizza/Wings for delivery to the hotel**"

The hotel is a 2 block walk from the Galleria and 4 blocks from Metro. Once you pass the Galleria on 6th street there is very little foot traffic and poorly lit streets the last two blocks. Also next to the hotel is a park where a lot of men congregate (several were homeless). On Saturday evening at 5:30 p.m. Jan 3, 2015. We were walking back to our room from the Verizon Center when two men confronted us when walking past the park on the sidewalk. By the grace of God when they asked for my purse and my husbands wallet, my husband flashed his badge and they ran off. When we got into the hotel I told the desk what had happen they said ""not a safe neighborhood to walk in after dark"". So we were afraid to leave the hotel that evening because of the unsafe walking conditions (closes restaurant 2 blocks in any direction). The hotel has a ""bar"" with a 32"" television and narrow seating area. Just try to image 40 people trying to watch the playoff football game. it didn't work. The next morning the breakfast area was crowded and the counters are so tight, its like trying to serve 40 to 50 people in your own kitchen. Then add the staff knocking guests out of the way to get to the trays for refills. When we walked in the room each head board had a note that said ""duvet covers & sheets are clean for your arrival,"" don't know about you but that is what I expect when I pay to stay at a Hampton, don't need a note. The hot tub jets didn't work and the pool heater was broken. Our hotel view was of two city corners, both under construction. HORRIBLE BIRTHDAY WEEKEND FOR ME!"

The location was great very close to the Verizon center, Chinatown, great resturants, and shopping. The suite we had was very nice and clean. The first night I had a problem with my heating unit I called the front desk and they sent an engineer up to fix it in less than 60 secs. There was a little chipped paint in the bathtub but it didn't bother us much. The view from the window was a bit of an eyesore due to the fact that there was construction going on across the street. However, there was no construction workers working that weekend so the outside noise was very minimal. The only thing that bothered me really was the fire-engines and ambulances periodically driving by. The hotel had a free REAL continental breakfast which was a plus. Besides the minor cons my overall stay was really great and I will definitely return again."

After reading reviews about noise from construction across the street, before our trip I called the reservationist and asked for a room away from the noise, as I was recovering from a recent medical procedure and needed a good night's rest. A manager assured me I would be given a ""quiet room"" on the backside of the hotel. I thought that was great. Was assigned to room 316, which has a King Bed and a sofabed. It was clean, spacious, and the bed was comfortable. There was also a microwave oven and a mini fridge which was very convenient to store beverages. But then considerable noise ensued. Every time someone went in and out of a room you could hear the loud slamming of a door. It was so loud that our room door would shake and rattle each time someone went in and out. It also sounded like someone was trying to get into our room. It turned out there were a number of teens on our floor on a field trip. They were well behaved. All they were doing was going in and out of their rooms to meet up with their group. We also heard a very loud conversation going on between a man and a woman and thought it was happening right outside our door. But when my daughter went out to check, no one was there. Turned out the conversation was going on four rooms down, from inside the room. The couple was not talking excessively loud, it's just that the sound carried quite far. Finally, on Friday morning I was woken at 7 a.m. (I planned to sleep till 9) to the loud sound of a garbage truck pulling up to the dumpster located three floors below our room. For the next 45 minutes all we could hear was loud banging and booming, and the crushing of glass. All I wanted was a good night's sleep from this hotel, in a ""quiet room"" as promised. That did not happen. Had I been staying longer than two nights I would have switched hotels. Management please take note. Instead of sending a message that you are sorry for the inconvenience, please do something about the room doors. They slam loudly. Also, if you promise someone a ""quiet room"" it should not be located right above the dumpster on trash collection days. Honestly, when I saw the earplugs on my nightstand that you provided, I should have known something was up."

The room included a fridge & microwave. I was on the 10th floor, so I had a view of the Washington Monument from my bed! The room was clean & nice. A tiny bit run down, but I've been in the hospitality business, so I pay attention to those tiny details, like cracked trash cans & dirty walls. The air conditioner did make an annoying vibrating sound, but once I put my shoes on top it stopped! The best part was the breakfast. The best of any Hilton Hotel I've stayed at yet! We ate outside one morning, it was so nice. The staff was on top of keeping everything fresh & made sure that nothing ran out. At night, the bar was always full & vibrant. The front desk staff was very helpful & pleasant. The beds/pillows were great. There was a desk, a dresser, an armchair in the room too. There is a Safeway at the end of the block. There was construction across the street - but where is there not construction in DC??? I never heard any noise from the construction site, but the hotel actually provides ear plugs for you! Soap/Shampoo was Neutrogena. The water pressure was good & you could actually change the shower head. I will for sure stay here again if I visit DC again & I will recommend this hotel to others!"

The fact that we returned on our next trip to Washington, DC should speak volumes. The service was still impeccable. They still have the buffet breakfast, which includes the do-it-yourself waffles, eggs, sausage, pastries and much more. We were there for nine days and most of the time elected to go out for breakfast. They have a nice little bar in the lobby, with happy hour specials. The bartender, Sean, was great. The room was again very nice. It was fairly quiet in terms of noise from other rooms. However, there was a fair amount of noise from the construction of a new building across the street, starting at about 7am. Not much they can do about that, I guess. However, this was somewhat offset by being able to observe (from the eleventh floor) the work that was going on, and the day-to-day progress. The WiFi is free but not very good at all. Good 4G coverage obviously. You get multiple bars on your phone even underground on the Metro. I wonder if DC gets special treatment in terms of cell and data coverage?The hotel is a brief walk from the Chinatown/Gallery Metro stop. We never had a big problem walking to the Metro but there are a fair amount of panhandlers, etc who will seek out anyone who looks like a tourist. You can cut down on this significantly by walking west on Massachusetts Avenue and turning left (south) on 7th. Be sure to check out the Engine Number 6 Restaurant a short walk east on Massachusetts Ave."

As in 2012, the property remains in good condition. The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable and the common areas are pleasant. The main difference is the surrounding area. In 2012, the hotel was right on the edge of what appeared to be a less than stellar neighborhood. You wanted to stay on the south and west side of Massachusetts Avenue because the other direction looked sketchy. Since my last visit, they have torn down some of the questionable buildings on the west side of 6th Street and are constructing two new buildings. I have attached two photos showing a view of the construction from my 10th floor window. So, the good news is, the surrounding area seems to be slowly improving. The bad news is, there is a large construction site directly across from the hotel. I was up early, so the noise did not bother me, but I can see how it might annoy someone who is trying to sleep in. If you plan on getting up late, perhaps request a room that is not on the side of the building facing 6th Street. On a separate note, in one of the photos I am attaching you can see the Washington Monument in the upper left hand corner (covered in scaffolding), which gives you a sense of where the hotel is located in relation to the National Mall."

We had a one bedroom king suite, which was enormous for two people. The cost was pretty reasonable, considering the facilities, space and location. Staff members were all very pleasant and helpful. There was a lounge area (with TV, sofa, two lounge seats, computer desk and chair, etc, etc.); a bedroom (with another TV and plenty of storage drawers); bathroom (divided into a washbasin area with a wardrobe behind folding mirrored doors, and a room with a bathtub/shower and a toilet); and a kitchen area (with a small refrigerator, coffee maker, sink and microwave). We had a reasonable view of the Washington Monument from the window.The room was kept very clean. When we arrived, there were two bottles of water and two small packets of Oreo cookies, but these were not replaced during our stay. There were also fresh filter coffee sachets, which were replaced.Generally the room decor was in good condition and comfortable, but the lounge chairs and sofa showed signs of fraying at the edges. The folding door to the wardrobe did not open very well and needed a bit of a heavy push to get it to close. Other than these, everything was fine. We slept well on the very comfortable bed and were not bothered by noise from traffic or other rooms.The aircon, which was located below two windows, was a little noisy and gave out quite a hefty blast (especially in the bedroom) even when the fan was turned low. This didn't really worry us because the nights were quite mild. Aircon in the corridors was icy! The hotel was not too full, and we had no problems with the elevators (even though we were on a high floor). Breakfast was OK and reasonable quality, with fresh fruit, waffles, breads, cakes, pastries, cereals, egg, etc. The serving area was a little crowded at peak times, but we could always find a table; and there were lots of throwaway plates/bowls/cups/cutlery.We felt safe in the hotel's location. There were Metro stations within a few minutes' walk, and some good restaurants in the area (such as Legal Seafoods and Matchbox). The White House, Capitol, Smithsonian Museums and main galleries were within easy walking distance. The memorials around the Tidal Basin can be reached on foot without too much effort if you are reasonably fit.Overall, we would be very happy to stay here again."

The hotel is well located for nearby restaurants. We visited Legal Seafoods, Jaleo (Spanish Tapas) and Oyamel (Mexican) and enjoyed them all. It is also close to the Chinatown / Gallery MetroRail station. We used the Metro on our first full day to reach Arlington National Cemetery. The National Mall is around 20-30 minutes on foot.The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We had no troubles with elevator access as reported in other reviews, but this may have been due to us avoiding peak times.Our only problem was with the breakfast room which was too small for the the number of guests trying to obtain the free breakfast. This looked to be caused by remodelling work in the reception area, so should be rectified in time. Our solution was to walk one block north to Busboys and Poets (next to Safeway) where they served excellent breakfasts.In fact some of the immediate area around the hotel was building work in progress. It appears that many older rundown buildings have been demolished to make way for offices and apartment blocks. However don't let this put you off. This is a good hotel close to many of the city's attractions and historic sites.I visited DC for one week with my wife. We arrived 31st Aug 2012 and checked out 7th September 2012.I called a few days before I arrived and spoke to ""Erica""and asked about getting a room away from the pool on the 2nd floor and away from vending machines/ work areas for staff. Erica assured me in a polite professional manner that it would be looked after for us... and it was, we had a wonderfull room on the 1th floorWe booked through a well known hotel booking site. However, we did note that had we left it a week before we arrived at the hotel, we could have got a better deal on the hotel's website. I guess most people do not want to take this gamble and neither did weWe had read the reviews here in TA and were a little concerned about breakfast and elevator issues, so here is my overall impression ....For visiting Washington DC, this hotel not just met our expetations but exceeded them. Staff were extremely polite and helpfull especially at the front desk. It's not often I single out any one staff member but Jeffrey at the front desk is an example to front desk's the world over of how to do business. He is a credit to the hotel and a wonderfull friendly person. In saying the previous, I do not wish to detract from all the other folk working at the hotel, we genuinely felt they were all excellentAs for the property itself, The free WiFi was really good with a strong workable signal in our room (1120), The AC was perfect and worked a treat. The room itself was spacious and the addition of a fridge and Microwave was an added bounus, although we did not use the microwave.The Queen beds were so cosy, it was hard to get out of them each morning. Flat screen TV worked well with plenty of channels. The bathroom had a wonderfull strong shower in it and of course doubled as a bath if one was so inclined. Another poster some time ago complained about the quality of the soaps, shampoo etc etc, but we found them above average for hotel supplied incidentals and they worked just fine for us (not sure if management changed them or not after previous posting)Although we found the elevators ( 2 of them ) slow sometimes, it was not an issue that bothered us at all.Now, to the reason I did not give the hotel a ""Excellent rating"". Although highlighted by other reviewers previously, we were expecting some difficulties with the breakfas arrangements. The Breakfast room had 5 long tables in it. At 4 of these tables 3 people could sit facing each other, but on one it was only possible for 3 peolpe to sit.bearing in mind that this hotel has 12 or 13 floors, the provision of 5 breakfast tables is clearly not enoughThe space in the breakfast room filled up very very quickly on the Sat, Sun and Monday morning at the start of our stay, this may have been because it was Labor Day weekend, but either way it was packed each morning with customers having to que to get in to the breakfast room. The Tea & Coffee machine was outside in teh lobby, making it very awkard to get coffee and a breakfast together. Management have suppied trays to take your breakfast back to your room if you prefer, but this did not appeal to us.The breakfast fare itself was quite adequate and I must praise the coffee which was really excellent. The provision of coffee and warm cookies every afternoon was delightfullThere is some renovation going on at the hotel on the lobby level but this was daytime and did not cause us any concern at allThe nearest metro stop was at ""Gallery Place / Chinatown"", a 4 minute walk from the hotel. At night the area around the Station had an uneasy feel to it, but no more so than any other ""uneasy feel"" you might get in any other city in the US or Europe.The Metro system is an excellent way of gettting around DC but be warned.. I have never encountered a subway system anywhere else in my travles with so many escalators not working., and when they are not working you can be almost guaranteed its the escalator going up that is broken not the one coming down, meaning you are constantly climbing up stairs and in summer this is not easy with the heat.The Circulator bus has a stop almost outside the hotel on the route that goes from Union Station to Georgetown. It's a dollar a ride no matter how long or short your ride is. But beware, on a Saturrday night we asked a driver going to Georgetown wha time the service ended at that night and he told us 2AM, then when we went looking for a bus at 1130PM we were told it ended at 9PMOver all, the Hampton In is a great choice for visiting DC and yes, I would have no hesitation in staying again or recommending it to anyone"

The staff were unfailingly polite, helpful and knowledgeable. Moreover the staff were cheerful and seemed happy to be working there. Everything worked as promised (although the fitness centre could be better equipped with free weights). The location is good for access to most of the parts of DC I needed to get to. I couldn't have been more happy with my decision to stay here.My husband and I stayed at the Hamptonn Inn 1 night in early June 2012. We arrived late and tired after 4 days in New York. We were welcomed by a nice lady, check-in was easy and quick. The room/bathroom was really clean, spacious and modern. We also had a microwave and fridge, nice big flat screen TV, desk, laptop tray. The bed was really comfy and huge! The breakfast was really good, the quality and variety of the food was excellent. I like the fresh fruit salad. It was a plus for me to be able to eat fresh fruits in the morning before a day walking out. The hotel is ideally located, only 10 min from the mall, US Capitol. If you want to go to Georgetown, you can take a bus called ""Circulator"". It only costs $1 per ride and they have many bus stops. There is even one 1 min walk from the hotel!We did not use the pool as we did not have the time. We had a late flight the next day and we were able to leave our bags with the concierge. While waiting for our airport shuttle in the main lobby, we were offered fresh cookies and lemonade! Really nice!The staff was really really nice, helpful, friendly. I have already recommended the hotel to friends who are planning a visit to Washington DC.We have also stayed in another Hampton Inn during our holiday and it was nice as well. It seems to be a very reliable hotel chain. Thank you to all the staff!"

The hotel was decent. The room was extremely small and looked out on a center lot full of trash receptacles and debris. The walls that our room looked out on were loaded with grafitti. The distance to the monuments/museums required cab / bus rides. The indoor pool was small but nice. The breakfast was decent but the eggs were horrible. Parking was exorbitantly high but we managed to get a package that included parking. All in all I'd say it was decent. I would consider staying again if I could get the parking/room package for under two hundred.

We were not disappointed! The hotel staff really cares about your needs - just let them know! We were given a great room upgrade by Toral, and she had to work really hard to ""make it work"" - but she did it all the same! THANK YOU, TORAL!! There is a microwave, a fairly large mini-frideg, and an in-room safe! I do agree with some of the other reviewers who wrote that some of the furniture needs an upgrade - it does, but that is happening floor by floor, and should be completed soon. But the beds - very importantly - are the same wonderful beds for which the Hampton Inns across the nation are famous. Maria and her friendly staff make sure you are well fed at breakfast. THANK YOU, MARIA! Jeffrey, at the reception desk, helps make sure you have a smile whenever you walk by. On to the great location - right across the street from a bus stop and two blocks away from a Metro station. If you will order a ""Smart Card"" from the D.C. website, you can load the card with however much money you think you will need (we ordered two $30 cards) which will take care of all your transportation needs - it can be used on the Circulator (costs just $1.00 a ride - even all the way to Georgetown), the busses, and the Metro. SO EASY! We rode the ""yellow line"" Metro in from the airport and saved BIG BUCKS on a taxi. I was a bit skitterish about riding the metro in with suitcases, but it was easy, fast and I felt safe the entire time. We took the ""green"" Circulator route to the Woodland Park Zoo. That was easy, and only cost $2.00 roundtrip! We also took the ""red"" Circulator to Georgetown for a fun day of shopping and eating! We had a great meal at Old Glory Barbecue in Georgetown. We rode the yellow line Metro to Alexandria. Great shopping and dining there as well! If you use your Smart Card and fearlessly use the public transportation available in D.C. and the surrounding areas, you can see soooo much in a city WORTH exploring - and do it all knowing you will come ""home"" to the Hampton and be treated like family. They'll even have free warm cookies and lemonade for you to start your evening off right!! You'll be happy you booked your D.C. vacation here!! We'll be back!"

A very friendly bell-boy took our luggage to our large rooms, and the personnel at the reception was very friendly. Unfortunately our toilet broke down, and we had to call the reception twice before it was fixed the first time. It broke down again three times after that, but we could immediately switch rooms the moment we asked for that. The breakfast was somewhat special. There's not enough room for all the guests to sit, so sometimes you ran into people eating their breakfast in the lobby. The most remarkable thing were the disposable cups, plates and cutlery we had to use. For a hotel of this price range you would expect at least decent tableware. Still, our weekend in DC was amazing, partly thanks to this hotel and the friendly staff."

The rooms are of a good design and spacious, the staff helpful, and it seemed very oriented to families. But the breakfast was one of the worst buffet meals - with disposable plates and cutlery - that I have encountered anywhere. A decent breakfast place close by would probably do a great trade from guests at this hotel. Paper cups in the otherwise nice bedroom also cheapened the tone. A few extra dollars for a hotel with a little more charm would be well worth the outlay."

Great hotel!,We just returned from a family trip to DC with 2 boys 9 & 13. We stayed 2 nights at the Hampton Inn which I highly recommend. It is in a great location. Easy walk to the metro and about 10-15 min walk to the main tourist spots.We walked at about 11 p.m. and felt completely safe.Room was perfect. We had a King Study with a pull-out. Tons of room. fridge/micro. pull-out was ok for comfort but kids were beat and fell asleep without complaints!breakfast buffet was perfect for us. Kids loved having lots of choices every morning. waffle-maker was a hit!! We were there Friday & Sat. Sat was very crowded for breakfast.Staff very nice and helpful.Negatives: don't go for the pool. It is nice extra - but it is very small and it was very crowded with little kids. Adults really don't plan on using it or the hot tub unless you really like children.Business room internet s#cked!! don't plan on using it for anything important. The kids could use it for games but I was not able to get maps printed off because it shut down all the time.Overall - very worthwhile! can't imagine anything better in our price range.

The first room they assigned us did not have much of a view so the desk staff readily switched us to another room with a great view of the Washington Monument, the 6th & I Street Historic Synagogue, and the beautiful evening sunsets. Jeffrey, a front desk staff member, recommended the Busboys & Poets Grill for our first evening meal, a place my partner and our granddaughter and I all enjoyed. Jeffrey also directed us to a nearby Safeway for groceries and snacks, and he was helpful in giving us directions to some of our touring destinations. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotless. Our room safe did not work so a maintenance person immediately installed a new safe. The breakfast crew were friendly and welcomed us each morning as though we were long-time friends. There was a wide variety of breakfast choices and we were pleased with each morning meal. The hotel was ideally located for us since we depended on catching the Metro (subway) at the nearby Chinatown Metro Station each day. The hotel swimming pool is not large and it became crowded a couple of evenings when school groups were at the hotel; however, even with school groups staying at the hotel, the hallways and rooms were peaceful and quiet. Rooms have small refrigerators and microwaves, so we prepared one meal each day in the room. Three of us showered each morning and we never experienced a shortage of hot water. Most D.C. hotel rates are fairly high, but the Hampton Inn rates are quite reasonably priced."

There is free wifi and a free breakfast. The breakfast was wonderful. Also, when you came into the lobby after a long day out, they had free chilled water bottles - they were wonderful after being out in 90+ temps.WE stayed for 3 nights and have no complaints at all. On the first night, we needed directions to the Hard Rock Cafe and they were nice enough to print them up for us. On the morning we were leaving, we needed a taxi at 5 am - and they had one at the door in literally 30 seconds. I love the place and will stay again when we go back next year."

Everything about it accounts for a memorable and pleasant stay.The hotel's location is decent. Union Station is a short walk away, and other locations can be conveniently reached. Chinatown is only a block away, providing varied and plentiful restaurants in arm's reach.The hotel's rooms are great! My room was the quietest in which I have stayed. The beds are superb, and the amenities and condiments are perfectly adequate. I particularly enjoyed my welcome card from Housekeeping, who kept my room spotless and homely. Although not the most luxurious, certainly the most notable room and stay I am yet to have.Every member of staff were simply incredible! Check in was quick, and very personable. The check in agent was very friendly, professional and above all, appeared human, having shared a laugh or two. Mayra, a staff member at breakfast, was extraordinarily polite, and ensured my table was kept clear. I was also farewelled and wished a pleasant day, which was a nice touch.Breakfast itself was perfectly adequate, and varied from cereals, toasts, pastries, coffee, juice, eggs, waffles, bacon, sausages, fruit and much more. It was varied each day also, which is very welcome if staying a few nights!The gym and pool are convenient and well maintained. I had no trouble finding an available treadmill, and the pool was never considerably busy during my stay.My one minor concern was the lift. You will find yourself waiting quite lengthy periods for a lift, particularly if the hotel is busy, and the hotel appears to be regularly filled with individuals staying for business, more so than the traveller or guest of leisure. Should you not wish to wait lengthy periods for a lift, I would suggest requesting a lower floor.I had no problem with the hotel. Overall, I have had one of my best stays here. I will certainly stay at Hampton Inn Washington, DC again, given the opportunity, particularly if I would like to ensure a remarkably pleasant stay."

They provide all the basics with a minimum of fuss and hassle, and this one is no different. Good quality bed. Minimal hallway noise even though we were RIGHT in front of the elevator. Good TV, lots of outlets, plenty of lights, good water pressure in the shower, and plenty of space in the bathroom. There is also an indoor pool (which we didn't use) and a fitness center (which we did use).The location is pretty good. There is a Safeway two blocks away to buy groceries, and a CVS down the street as well. The Red Circulator line is a block away ($1 to get down to the National Mall), and the Yellow Circulator line runs outside the hotel to go toward the White House or to Union Station. Chinatown and the Metro station are a 5 minute walk away with plenty of restaurants. Or you can walk down to the National Mall as well (1 mile, maybe 15 minute walk).Free breakfast is what you would expect at any other Hampton. Eggs are kind of tasteless and the pastries/bagels are store-bought. But it's free, there's lots of juice, cereal, Yoplait/Activia yogurt, and even hard-boiled eggs. Internet is free, both Wi-Fi and wired (cable provided). The business center computers kinda suck, and I had a hard time printing my boarding pass one morning (got it eventually). But the staff are excellent and helpful and you can tell they're working hard to service you.Would definitely come back."

The room was adequate and had all the necessary things like a mini fridge, a microwave, a TV, a king-size bed, and nice-sized desk for my laptop. The Internet connection worked well, but I wouldn't say it was blazing fast. Everything seemed clean and everything was functional. The breakfast was a good deal, although the day I used the breakfast to go was disappointing. All in all, I'd recommend a stay, especially if you're doing stuff in the area.My room was on the 6th floor and the window overlooked 6th St. This seemed to be a very loud arrangement. The hotel is about three blocks from a fire station, so I had a couple fire trucks or ambulances loudly go past my room each hour between about 5:00 and 10:00 p.m. It also seemed like I could hear more noise from the hall or other rooms than I have at some other hotels, but it was nothing that I could call a real problem.I enjoyed the breakfast (included in the room price) the day I used it. They had all the usuals — cold cereal, juices, fruit, yogurt, bagels, and (the day I was there) cheese omelettes. It all tasted good. I also liked that they had doughnuts and a selection of caffeine-free teas. It's worth noting that the tea, coffee, and hot chocolate were available at any time, as were some apples by the front desk. On the other day I was there for breakfast, I was leaving very early, so I grabbed one of the hotel's bagged breakfasts. With only a muffin, granola bar, apple, and water bottle, it was rather disappointing. It just wasn't very much.The location is pretty good. The hotel is right by, as advertised, the DC convention center. This is also only a couple blocks from the Verizon Center. Major sights like the White House, the Mall, the various Smithsonian museums, and the Capitol, are within walking distance (about a mile at the most). One final note about the location: if you're flying into BWI, you can get to this hotel for under $40.00 using the Super Shuttle service.So, the hotel is frills-free, but was functional, and I would recommend it. As with all hotels in DC, it is over-priced."

Providing warm/soft cookies at the front desk during the evening hours and always having coffee/tea available at any point in the day. The breakfast has always been outstanding with servers constantly and consistently replenishing food/drinks/cutlery. It is perfectly situated to the D.C.

Comfortable beds, clean, with the amenities we needed - free wifi, microwave, fridge, cable tv and free breakfast. My room was right across from the elevator on the 4th floor, but it was very quiet and I never heard any elevator noise. Other than an occasional ambulance siren (which could happen anywhere), I didn't hear any steet noise. The beds were very comfortable and the room was big enough for the two of us sharing a room to move around easily. The buffet breakfast had plenty of choices: eggs, yogurt, fruit, waffles you make yourself, and other things. The breakfast area was clean and well stocked. Breakfast is the only meal available at the hotel, but it's helpful to eat while at the hotel so that once you leave, you can concentrate on sightseeing and not finding a place for breakfast.Some reviewers commented on slow elevators, but we didn't notice a problem. The staff was wonderful and gladly helped us with whatever we needed... hailing a cab or pointing me to the ATM machine.The hotel is right off a main road, so it's easy to find. The parking is $34 day, but any DC hotel that has parking charges about the same. We decided to keep the car parked at the hotel and take cabs to our various destinations within the city. For us, it was easier to do that and just split the cab fares. If you decide to do the same, I highly recommend Robert's Limousine Service. He is usually outside the hotel and the concierge can call him for you. We found him priced on par with the regular cabs, if not cheaper, with a much more pleasant disposition! His phone # is [--]."

The rooms were clean and spacious. The view was pretty uninteresting but as most time is spent out of the room it didn't matter. Self-serve breakfasts were nice, difficult to get a table at times but worth the wait.

When we got back from sightseeing the 1st day, the hotel told us that the air conditioning wasn't working on our floor (10th) and we got reassigned a new room. (713) The room was very clean, and so were the bathrooms. There was a tv (only limited channels, if you wanted more, you had to pay). a microwave, a mini fridge, and a coffeemaker. They serve free breakfast from 6:00am to 10:00am, but i would advise you come early, because later at about 9:00 and 10:00 there are crowds. Also, the breakfast was very good, and the hot food was different everyday, which we liked. The breakfast staff was very friendly as well. There is a pool, which we visited, a business center with 3 computers, and a fitness room. There was also a place where you could do laundry and dry cleaning, if you stayed a little longer. This hotel is in downtown D.C, so you see many homeless people in the park benches across from the hotel and by Chinstown. They didn't talk to us, but i would advise you not to walk around this area at night. We could see the washington monument from our room; it was very far away, but we could still see it. Also, an added plus: at around 7:00, they have free chocolate chip and Oatmeal cookies and lemonade. I would also advise you NOT to rent a car, because valet parking is 34$ and why would you rent a car when there are metros and busses and plus:eveything is in walking distance from metro and bus stops? Overall, our family loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone."

The free breakfast had an enormous variety - fruit, cereals, yogurt, pastries, bagels, a different type of eggs & meat each day, juices and 3 coffee choices. There is a small indoor pool, which our kids enjoyed almost every evening, and a whirlpool. My ONLY complaints are that the A/C didn't get cold enough for us (my husband likes it cold) and the parking cost $34 per night - but I think that's about what it is everywhere in DC. Otherwise we were extremely pleased with everything about our stay at the Hilton."

My room is clean and tidy. The working table has a total glass top. It has a small refrigerator and microwave. The cover of the microwave was broken showing some of the circuitry but it still functioned. The room is not big but of reasonable size. There was some noise when the window air conditioner started up, also when some trucks ran by.My room is facing the intersection. The location of the hotel is close to subway station and China town. I had a dinner in China town. It tasted awful and was expensive.There is self parking just across the street (see photo).The breakfast has a lot of varieties and 2 hot items and of good quality. The breakfast area looks spacious but can be filled up pretty fast.Originally, I preferred at least a 3 star hotel, but this hotel exceeds my expectation."

The hotel was very nice - the breakfast is truly a FULL breakfast- omelets, scrambled eggs, cereal, toast, fruit, coffee.... and on and on. Even though the $34 per day for parking seemed a bit steep, it was well worth it. We never used the car - we took the Metro everywhere. The location of the hotel is convenient to lots of restaurants and shopping. No complaints! We'll be back.... to do the White House & Capitol Tour hopefully!"

As with all Hampton Inns, the staff was attentive and helpful, the rooms were good size and the beds and pillows were top notch. The free breakfast was worth the stay. This is no bread and nutella meal, this is a buffet breakfast - free. For a family of four to stay here, the money you save daily on a breakfast you'd get at a restaurant is worth paying a little more for the room. Free coffee, tea, and fruit available 24 hrs a day in the lobby, as well as free snacks (cookies, etc) every evening 6pm.The BAD: The location leaves something to be desired. It is located next to a park that is a homeless person hang out. Passed the hotel, one block up, the neighborhoods turn Dodgy. It is a 5-10 minute (4 block) walk to the metro, and that walk got old fast, especially if you come and go 2-3 times a day. The walk at night can be sketchy, passing some less then model citizens on the streets, but we never had a problem. The Convention Center is 2 blocks away - toward the seedy part of the neighborhood.MISC: The Gallery Place/Chinatown metro that you walk to is located next to the MCI Center, with a city block of bars and restaurants. It is about a 15-20 min stroll to the National Mall, closer to the Capitol side.Will stay here again, as the hotel, rooms, service and breakfast outweighed the inconveniences of the location."

It was perfect for our family. Our suite was spacious and we enjoyed watching the street scene from the corner window. The staff was accomodating and friendly, right down to the housekeeping crew. The room and bathroom were clean and beds comfortable.It is a one mile walk from hotel to mall. The circulator buses ran every 10 minutes and stopped a block away but sometimes they were slow and once they had mechanical problems and we waited 40 minutes for a bus. We found the taxis in front of the hotel every morning were fast and reasonably priced. One morning we had to get to the Washington Monument before 8:30 to line up for tickets and the ride was $11 plus tip for the whole family.We walked to 7th street, a block away, for dinners. Someone said there are 60 restaurants along that street. Our favorite find was Clydes which had both pricey and inexpensive fare, was crowded but seated us in about 10 minutes and had both a kids menu and delicious vegetarian dishes. I really appreciated the 3 strengths of coffee available in the breakffast area each morning: premium, regular and unleaded! My kids loaded up on sausage pattis, ham and eggs. I liked the fresh fruit salad with pineapple, melon, grapefruit and orange sections on various days. Everything was kept well-stocked, even when busy.There is a laundry room in the hotel. It costs $1.50 per load to wash and to dry and soap available for a dollar or so. There was also a microwave and refrigerator in the room and we stopped at Trader Joes (at 25th street along the Georgetown circulator route) and bought dinner one evening to heat in our room. We got back to the hotel late a couple of nights and were not bothered by the homeless people in the park across the street. We were bothered by the emergency vehicles with their sirens blaring almost every night. We liked our view too much to ask for a room in back, but it would be a good idea for someone who has trouble getting back to sleep.We didn't get to see everything we wanted in Washington DC. We would be happy to stay at this Hampton Inn again when we return."

This is a great family hotel with free breakfast and a pool. It is spotless and has the most comfy beds ever. The free breakfast was very good with tea and coffee being available all day every day . It is in a great location and is close to the metro and lots of restaurants and bars.The staff were all very helpful particularly John at reception. The ony gripe we had was that we had asked for a room on a high floor which we did not get even though the room had been booked since last August.We did eventually move rooms but that was more to do with the fact that the rope on the flag outside of our window banged against the pole the whole night, so beware if its a windy night. Overall we loved the HI and would certainly stay here again.We all loved the hotel. Clean, nice breakfast, good people, internet access, near centre and generally very good taste.Too bad we only stayed there for one night. The only black spot is the parking which was not for free and we couldn't see were the car was. So we were a bit insecure.I definetely recommend it."

We booked the Hampton Inn Convention Center because it was within walking distance to the office my husband’s meeting was held in and because we are never disappointed with Hampton Inns. This one was no exception. We were greeted on the sidewalk and helped inside with our luggage. The lobby was exceptionally large and sported an aquarium, a concierge (first Hampton Inn I’d stayed in that offered that convenience) and coffee or tea and juices available all day. There is comfortable and ample seating to people watch. There is a business center with high speed computers available for those who don’t have their own computer.Checking in took minutes. When we were initially given a room on the second floor, I asked for a room on a higher floor, preferably a corner with a view to the south and we were cheerfully reassigned. We had room 902 which gave us a wonderful view, highlighted by the Washington Monument. The scrupulously clean room featured a king-sized bed, comfortable easy chair with ottoman, 25"" color television and high-speed internet access with a desk workspace. There was a microwave and small refrigerator and also a coffee maker and iron and ironing board. There was a tub and shower and plenty of toiletries and soft towels provided each day. The bed was dreamy, pardon my bad pun. Soft sheets, a choice of firm or soft pillows and a comforter that was just enough to keep us toasty during the night. The heater was controlled by a wall thermostat and our room was always comfortably warm.  The complimentary breakfast was different each day and offered several choices from toast and cereal to breakfast pizzas and biscuits and gravy, always accompanied by fresh fruit and yoghurt, several juice choices and milk and coffee. Each evening when we returned to the hotel we were greeted with the wonderful smell of chocolate chip cookies which tasted as good as they smelled.  The location of the hotel was perfect for sightseeing on foot. It was only a few minutes walk to the National Mall which many of the museums face. I walked to The White House and to the Lincoln Monument and made my way back past the Vietnam Memorial, the newer Korean Memorial and the brand new World War II Memorial to the Washington Monument. Being in Washington DC in January is a plus in spite of the cold weather and occasional rain showers because there are no crowds. There was no one in line to get a free ticket to ride the 70 seconds to the top of the Washington Monument and no one blocking my view through the small windows. Another day I walked through Downtown to Georgetown University and through some of the quaint neighborhoods in that area. There are plenty of transportation opportunities including the Metro a couple of blocks from the hotel, a Circulator Bus that stops in the same block and the Metro Buses, but I preferred to go at my own pace and stop and look at whatever I wanted and spend as much time as I wanted. I never felt uneasy or worried about my safety and with a map available at the concierge’s desk, it was easy to navigate. I wouldn’t feel uncomfortable walking alone in the evening to go out to eat or shop as long as I stayed south of Massaschusetts Avenue and no further east than 6th St. in the immediate area of the hotel. A highlight of our trip was the motorcade carrying President Bush back to the White House following the State of the Union address passed directly beneath our windows. Although we didn't catch a glimpse of the President through the heavily tinted windows of the limousine (which was actually no big disappointment!) we did enjoy the excitement of the motorcycles and police cars escorting the suburbans and limousines.I highly recommend the Hampton Inn Convention Center for its central location, excellent breakfast, friendly staff and the value especially compared to other hotels in the area. There are sirens of firetrucks and police cars day and night but that is to be expected in the center of a large metropolitan area and the sight of the Washington Monument viewed right out our window diminished any inconvenience or irritation."

This is the hotel I chose, taking into consideration the location, and the fact that it had a pool, and MOST importantly, the reader reviews here on Tripadvisor...honestly, they're as good as gold! Firsthand stories and reviews are truly priceless, we have quite a gift with this site! Once again, it has not failed us! This hotel was a great choice! It is beautiful and very clean. NO issues at all! We, personally, (not all rooms, of course) were extra surprised that we could see the Washington Monument from our window. (12th floor) It is, indeed right outside of China town, and please let us recommend the restaurant called ""Wok 'N Roll"". WOW! The food was fantastic, the service was great and very friendly, and I have to give EXTRA stars to my dinner choice...""General Tso's Tofu"". (I'm a vegetarian). It was DELICIOUS! You get a LOT of food for your money, too, as both my husband and I had a doggie bag for later! (that didn't stop us for ordering Dominoes pizza and having it delivered to our room...and that was great, too...was recommended to us by the locals as the best pizza choice in the evening...a little costlier than home, though, at $18.00 for a large pizza)As for people worried about the neighborhood, we had no problems. Actually and truthfully, the homeless people were the most hospitable! One of them directed us to the restaurant...which was a great choice, and I had researched it on the internet, so it was on my ""Good list""!, and one of them gave us impeccable directions when our busdriver was as helpful as a sponge. We tipped the homeless guy instead, needless to say. Driving in DC is a NIGHTMARE. BE PREPARED. It is so extremely frustrating. Our hotel was about 3 miles from the zoo but took us about an hour to reach, as the streets are so confusing! (e.g...You can be on third street for a minute, and suddenly you're not.) I honestly don't know what to tell you to recify that situation. It's awful. But I digress...The point is that the hotel was great. Check in wasn't the best, as THEY had the wrong name for me, and I had to call my father in law to find the confirmation number from my e-mail account-the hotel didn't help me out with that...so MAKE SURE IF YOU BOOK ONLINE YOU HAVE YOUR CONFIRMATION NUMBER ALONG WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's the most important bit of advice I can give you! BUT, that didn't retract from the awesomeness of the hotel, honestly. We put that behind us as soon as we were in our room, which was BEAUTIFUL!!!! The hotel put out really delicious cookies and iced tea in the lobby in the evening-that was fun. The pool was fun, but pretty cold, and the hot tub was nice and hot! If we have to stay in DC ever again, we would definitely choose this hotel! :o) Oh, and PS...we had a ball just sitting at our window ""people watching"" during the late night hours. VERY interesting sights to be seen below! (oh, and we didn't do the breakfast...we like to sleep in!----and the beds were SOOOOOOOOO comfy!!! WOW!) PLUS, do yourself a favor...no matter what you're in town for...drive over or grab a cab and see the monuments in ""the mall"" at night. So worth the trip-very beautiful!"

The water was also dangerously hot. The electronic locks on the doors were unbelievably loud (neighbors wake you up). The breakfast (served a building over) was awful. Most of the food appeared or tasted like it had been warmed over from previous days. I thought I'd never find a muffin I didn't like, but these were like hockey pucks. The location is in need of upkeep - there were even weeds (blooming thistles) in the yard area outside the lobby. It's a great location if you're doing business on Capitol Hill, but if you don't need to walk to the Capitol every day, you can find better hotels near Metro stops."

The couch in the other room could be converted into a full size bed and both rooms had large TVs.I want to mention about the breakfast specifically as I found it to be most generous and with plenty of options. They had everything from fruits, porridge, bread, cereals, omelets or scrambled eggs, cheese, turkey meat, salami, boiled eggs, baked potatoes, juice, muffins and cakes. Apart from this they had nice happy hours with wines. Tea/coffee, juice and lemon water was always free at the reception.The hotel is located just behind the Library of Congress building and steps away from Capitol South metro station which makes it very convenient to either go to the National Mall walking or take the metro to different places.Just a block away from the hotel on Pennsylvania avenue there are lots of restaurants, pubs and cafes so food was also very easy to get after a long day of walking through the streets of DC.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Washington DC. Two thumbs up and thank you!Wonderful service and nice staff . I would definitely stay here when I visit again. The gym was also well kept.

Wine hour from 5p-6p. Flavored water, coffee, tea always available.

The staff was super friendly and the room was quite large, comfortable and super clean. That being said, the bathroom was a bit small and cramped. Seems like the hotel was recently renovated as everything seemed nice and new. The hotel is close to the Capitol, lots of shops/restaurants and isn't far from Union Station as well (about a 5 minute cab ride). I will look to choose this hotel in the future and look forward to returning. My only complaint is that the hotel has digital room keys only vs standard plastic room keys. While the industry is going in that direction and many hotels are starting to offer digital keys, the digital key was the only option at the hotel. Unfortunately, this requires downloading an app and then it takes a few minutes of set up to get everything going, Unfortunately my digital key didn't work and we had to troubleshoot for a few minutes which caused check in to take about 15-20 minutes which was frustrating. This also caused a bit of a line at check in which is unfortunate. I am all for offering a digital key, but it should not be the only option until the kinks are worked out."

I have never been let down. The people at the front are great, the rooms are always clean, the rooms are rather spacious and great for business work. The breakfast is delicious and you are able to get in and out very quickly. Best of all, it’s right on Capitol Hill. All you have to do is walk out the door and you’re there. I recommend to everyone traveling on business to come and stay at the Capitol Hill hotel."

The lowest we could set our thermostat was 65 degrees but it couldn’t have been accurate. It felt more like 75 degrees. We asked to have it lowered but all they could offer was a box fan. The windows don’t open and there is no vent in the bathroom. Our room felt like a sauna after my husband and I each took a short shower. Blow drying my hair and getting dress were very uncomfortable. The bathroom and shower are very small and only one person can use it at a time. The mattress was firm but the pillows were lumpy. There is no light over the kitchenette area. The elevators are slow and the ice machine is on the first floor. Twice we had to get our keys reprogramed because they failed to work. The building is old and it appears that an inexpensive remodel was attempted. Instead of removing the “popcorn “ ceilings, several coats of paint were applied over it. A 25 year old a/c unit which was switched off for the winter is the only way to get circulation in the room. So, it was uncomfortablely hot."

First impressions when looking online was I needed somewhere close to the main attractions, airport and clean and this hotel fitted all these. On arriving at the hotel we got a lovely warm welcome from reception who quickly checked us in and explained where the coffee bar was, breakfast and also how to get to our rooms. The rooms were very clean and spacious and all came with air con. On entering the room we received a we note to say welcome to the hotel along with some sweets and buns. The bed was quite big and came with comfortable pillows and extra blankets if needed. They had a good selection off TV channels in the room along with microwave, sink and storage space next to the bathroom.Bathroom was a bath shower which was fine as it had a good powerful shower and new towels were provided daily. Down at reception you were able to purchase snacks, candy and microwavable food also to save going out to the shop. Where the hotel is you are within walking distance to Capital Building and the Hop on bus tours. I would highly recommend this hotel and plan to come back again in the near future. Kind Regards.My King room was large and clean. The ded was very comfortable, particularly after a long haul flight. Little to no excessive street noise allowed for a uninterrupted sleep. All staff I encountered were friendly and very helpful. A close walk to some eateries as well as metro stations. Overall very happy with my stay."

I chose this hotel because it was theoretically walking distance from both the start and the finish. Large city marathon, complicated logistics. Luckily, the hotel did everything imaginable to make it a comfortable night and a smooth day.I loved the charm and individuality of the hotel. Whoever decorated the lobby did so with creativity with plush upholstery and vibrant mixed patterns. There is a common room where breakfast is served, which has an urn of infused water at all times. The morning of the marathon, they had coffee there early on. It was a welcoming, soothing place to be when one is keyed up for a big day. There were quite a few participants staying there.The staff were friendly and accomodating. They were aware of the race, and knew exactly how to give me walking directions to the start, also offering several times to call me a car. I thought it was extra cute that they welcome pets. I had a smile watching some of the woofers parade in and out of the lobby.The room was very comfortable, with adjustable heat. The bathroom was lovely ,with L'Occitane products.There was a microwave and a mini fridge, so I was able to enjoy a quiet warmed-up dinner from home using my free wifi, which is exactly of what you need the night before a marathon. Looking for restaurants and sitting through dinner can really eat away into your sleep time. Everything was in working order and immaculate. There were plenty of glasses.I really lucked out with the valet parking, as my car got placed a few steps from the doorway. I was able to obsessively go through my stuff and pack the car in the wee hours of the morning without having to request the valet every time.Doing the full Marathon, and not the Half, I was not able to get a late checkout that enabled me to keep the room and shower. They did welcome me to use their lobby bathroom to change and freshen up after the race. I would recommend this hotel for any sort of visitor to DC. If you are in for DCMarathon 2018, and are up for a little walk or cab ride each way, this is a great place to stay. i would choose it again."

They typically have 15% or 20% off on the rooms, so visiting Truvago to find a 'good deal' shouldn't yeild better results.The neighborhood is nice and safe and it's enjoyable to walk freely outside. Pennsylvania Avenue and 8th Street have various shops and restaurants within walking distance from the hotel.Check-in was quick, staff were friendly and very accommodating. The valet parking was expensive, but very convenient. Pay close attention to where you will have to park if you don't purchase the hotel valet.Room 409 was clean, modern and felt very comfortable. Our room had two queen beds, a small kitchen and dining area, and a very nicely updated (but small) bathroom with a connected walk in closet area.We watched HBO and snacked on restaurant leftovers we placed in the kitchens​ fridge. We slept well and enjoyed our morning showers. We didn't partake in the free breakfast but the offerings looked well prepared and many other guest send to be enjoying everything. Check out was just as easy as checking in and the staff just as friendly.We spent 4 nights at the hotel, and found that they provided comprehensive and friendly services to their guests. Impressed by their valet parking services; complimentary wine and tea break sessions; laundry and gym rooms, we like the breakfast too though at one time, we observed insufficient seats for guests who came around 9:45am and need to bring food off the site. Apart from this, we have total satisfaction toward their customer services. Beside, the hotel honored our request for a quiet room. The receptionists including Patricia gave good suggestions on transportation as well as dining options. Will certainly recommend travelers to patronize this hotel and hope to be back one day!"

One member of the staff even moved his own car outside the hotel so that we could have free parking on the street for the weekend, rather than paying 50 dollars for the valet.

The reservation was during off-season, so the price was ridiculously low, but the service and amenities were wonderful. We had a mini-suite because we our two son's (13 and 9) were with us. The room was perfect for our needs. A bedroom with a King bed for us and a Queen pull out for the boys. The pull-out was not stellar, my older son said it was not very comfortable, but he managed.The bathroom was small, but had everything we needed. Shower had great pressure and the provided toiletries were heavenly smelling.There was enough room for us to not be in each others way all the time. Not that we wanted to spend our hours in the hotel! D.C. is a magical place, full of history and beauty. The Capitol Hill Hotel was so close that the only thing between us and the Library of Congress - Jefferson Building was a couple of deli's, literally! There was delicious food within 5-10 minutes walk, Pizza, Tacos, Italian or regular American fare. Plus, a Saloon bar with great bartenders that are begging you to let them invent something for you.If there were any items I would have liked to change it would be that first, the pillows were a little too full. I had to steal a smaller one from the kids bed. And two, the breakfast wasn't great. We were there 5 nights and it was pretty much the same each time; oatmeal, eggs, sausage, toast/pastry, cereal, juice/coffee. But the bakery around the corner took care of that handily."

Our room had been recently remodeled with wood floors and new sitting area furniture. The bathroom was very modern and the shampoo and conditioner included is now my wife's favorite. She has already ordered it in Amazon. The only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer. If I had to name something I didn't like it would be the $50 per night Parking fee. Unfortunately any hotel has about the same charge. The staff were first class and the breakfast which was included in price was more than adequate! The location of the Capitol Hill hotel is phenomenal. The neighborhood is great with alot of cool places to eat and bars to wind down after a long day. We walked from the hotel all the way down the National Mall to the White House and back logging about 9 miles. If you don't want to walk, the hotel has bikes for rent out front.

A 10 minute walk will get you to the Capitol and Union Station and every form of public transportation you'll need. The National Mall is close by to enjoy all DC has to offer. There are a variety of restaurants within a five minute walk where I found Sweetgreens that serves super fresh salads made to order. There are also a couple of pubs and a liquor store in this area. The hotel includes a daily breakfast that isn't gourmet but has enough variety to satisfy everyone in your group. The room decor was pleasant and the layout comfortable. It included a mini-kitchen, in room safe, shampoo, conditioner and soap dispensers in the shower and a VERY comfortable bed with quality bedding. I felt safe in the neighborhood at all times. The staff was friendly but not meddlesome and everyone from the front desk to housekeeping to kitchen staff were keen to ensure happy guests. On weeknights, they serve cold white wine and red wine in the lounge from 5-6 pm. There isn't much to do for young children (no pool or play area) but I did see small pets.

Friday rate was about $165, Saturday was $180. The hotel is only a block and a half away from the Metro stop Capitol South in a tree lined residential neighborhood mixed with government buildings. It is also only two blocks from restaurants and shops on Pennsylvania Avenue. It's a very lovely area and very convenient to the train. There are only five floors, we stayed on the top floor.PROS:Lobby: Spacious lounge area and lots of seating. Modern, clean, hip decor. Free bike rentals. Friendly service at reception. Free Washington Post and USA Today. Free breakfast located in adjoining building (did not visit), but the main building had coffee/tea, orange juice, instant oatmeal, granola bars, fruit and banana bread. There's a small shop for snacks.Room: King Bed (even though we reserved Queen), plenty of big pillows, spacious room, modern and clean decor, work desk with lots of outlets for recharging, wingchair, lots of drawers, two windows, two closets, a mini fridge, mini sink, k-cup coffee maker, microwave, flat screen TV with lots of channels. Free WiFi.Bathroom: Small but adequate, pocket door, single sink/vanity, tub with curved shower rod, GREAT water pressure, hairdryer, fluffy towels, one bathrobe for use ($75 to buy), one umbrella for use ($35 to buy), $5 for bottled water, $15 shaving kit. GREAT L'Occtaine toiletries.CONS: I barely have anything negative to say about our stay. The only issues we had were that the digital safe in our room was a little glitch and I would have to repeatedly enter our code a few times in order for it to open and that the room wasn't soundproofed, so we heard occasional hallway door noise and traffic/trucks.We recently spent a week in DC, and picked the Capitol Hill Hotel for our stay. Located 1 1/2 blocks from the Metro Blue Line, no car is necessary. The hotel is walking distance from everything on Capitol Hill, including the Library of Congress, Shakespeare Library, Supreme Court, Mall, and the Capitol. Good restaurants just a few blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue. The staff is courteous and very professional. The rooms are well appointed, some with kitchenettes. For us, it's now the place to stay in DC."

Close to the night there also were free homemade cookies! :)The staff of the reception are the nicest i've ever met! I think, that i got a trainee at my check in. He was a little bit nervous (it wasn't so obvious), but so nice and caring and provided me with all information i need! Bravo amazing reception workers! :)Breakfast was good with some amount of different options. There's laundry room in the hotel and you can buy washing powder at the reception, which is huge plus to the hotel! The location is really nice.

We really enjoyed our stay. We felt the hotel was more of an inn with personal service and accommodating staff, very good breakfast and good sized clean rooms. It is close to everything on Capitol Hill. We had a very nice view of the church across the street and on to the Capitol beyond and even a sunset the evening we arrived. We will definitely be back.This place has a great location in a nice neighborhood.You can walk or drive to everything. The room was super comfortable. Love the bathroom, great shower and fun soaps.

The room is very spacious, stylish, comfortable and clean. No dust bunnies were present in common places such as under the bed or behind the couch. The local activity suggestions offered on the card holder and in-room pamphlet alongside the welcome letter are a nice and welcoming touch. The pumpkin themed events and amenities offered throughout the month of October are enough to prove to me that Capitol Hill Hotel is active in providing a unique and fun experience year round. The valet parking fee is a little steep but the hours offered to leave your car are convenient for any plans you may have before and after checkout. Their combination of service, facilities and location make every rate a bargain price. I would recommend and return to this hotel at any given opportunity."

The suite is huge - a separate kitchen and living area. Separate, good-sized TVs in the living and bedrooms. It has been modernized and is attractive. There are thoughtful touches like a large full-length mirror and an I-home clock radio that works with the newest Iphone. The breakfast is wonderful. Everything you could want is there. Hot sausage and eggs. Cheese and cold cuts. Hot oatmeal. Great pastries. One of the best things about this hotel is the staff. Our Sunday and Morning breakfasts were very crowded, but there were at least 3 people visible at all times refilling things and directing guests to empty tables. The capable staff made the difference in my 5 star review. If some of you are a little picky, there are some nicks in the paint here and there, but all the advantages of this hotel outweigh those. I experienced absolutely no noise problems and there was a wedding going on at the hotel. Our view was lovely. We stayed in 307. The location cannot be beat. About a block and a half from Capital South metro stop. In walking distance to Eastern Market. Tons of super restaurants in walking distance.

I'm really happy I chose this hotel to treat myself for a night. I agree with others: it's a hidden gem. Hopefully, when I use it again, it'll be just as great. Breakfast goes until 11 on the weekend. Improvement: I wish they had feminine toiletries for a girl emergency. I couldn't go to any of the stores in the middle of the night because everything was closed. Even the metro according to google. I was able to deal so I didn't bother w/ taking a taxi to a walgreens, but it still would've helped a lot if they sold those items at that little stand next to the front counter. I asked if they had any and she said unfortunately, no. (Yes, I'm talking about pads.)"

My husband and I have traveled in Europe and this reminded me of our stays in boutique hotels there. The staff is so knowledgeable of the area, quick to help in any way, and so polite! I absolutely love the diverse staff, even getting a chance to talk to a few of the staff from different areas of the world that were so happy to talk about where they are from (the US history teacher in me always comes out!). My family and I stayed two nights and went to both home NATS games. It was nearly a mile walk, a little rough on the kids when it's midnight and super hot, but truly went by fast. When you can see the US Capitol building, see some of the old buildings of the city, parks, landscaping.....it is all worth it. During the day we walked to the Eastern Market, about a 10 minute walk to GREAT little restaurants. We stopped at one pizza place, Seventh Hill Pizza on 7th Street that was a little on the pricy side, but SO GOOD. The pizzas were fast and the service fantastic. There is also a We The Pizza right around the corner from the hotel that is FANTASTIC!!!! Pizza not as good as Seventh Hill, but cheaper, huge eating area, and great drink selection. It's a great atmosphere!!The hotel itself.....the building you check into has rooms there as well as a building adjacent to it. We stayed in the adjacent building. The complimentary breakfast was great. And I highly suggest getting the parking deal when making a reservation. Parking was a breeze and breakfast great. I liked that breakfast was in the building where we stayed. Our room was spacious....felt like an apartment. (due to the fact it used to be townhomes I believe earlier). We had a full fridge, microwave, stovetop, Keurig coffee maker....it was great! The bathroom was small and other reviews complained, but I don't need a big bathroom, so it didn't bother me! The beds were AMAZING and we got such a great night's sleep. One reviewer mentioned the curtains were sheer, but we didn't have that problem. We were in room 410....and although the view was less than spectacular, it was a great room. Two queens and a sofa bed."

This hotel is a very short walk (3-4 blocks/5-7 minutes) to the House buildings and to the Capitol. There are two buildings. The one on the corner is where you check in, the other building is where the breakfast is held. I stayed on the 4th floor of the second building. The suite was very large with a bathtub, and a kitchenette (sink, microwave, and refrigerator). Maid service was good. No room service, but you are close to a few small restaurants. Easy check-in. Robes, umbrella, iron, ironing board, safe and utensils are in the room. Nice thermostats/temperature control in the rooms. Good window covers to keep out light. The breakfast was great; scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, lunch meats, cheeses, oatmeal, muffins, biscuits, cereal, yogurt, juice, coffee, toast. The breakfast area is crowded, but the turnover is fast. Perhaps the table could be wiped down in between guests, but other than that I was very happy with it. A few paper towels in the kitchen would be helpful. I would definitely stay here again if I am in the area."

Moreover, the area for foods were tiny and of course only few choices too.Moreover, I was checked-in a a connecting room, the room was spacious in general, the thing which not in general was the bath room, quite tiny indeed. Door to door was only separated by two toy doors, sound isolation and security level were mess. I would say anyone who possess very little techniques and skills on door lock, 5 secs and then Bingo.One more strange I encountered during my stay, as I said, the bathroom was small but the water pressure and other facilities were also in good status, by the way, the problem goes to the only one window in the bathroom, a totally transparent window, not a frosted glass or with a curtain, just nothing (see my picture), so I need to paste some newspaper on it for cover, what a joke!!!!I did request to change my room, but the consequence was sadness. The receptionists some were friendly and some were cool.Finally, the hotel was clean and well-decorated."

The location is great, one block from the metro, a few blocks from the capitol and a bunch of other sight seeing buildings (too many to name here) and its also a 20 min walk to the Navy yard. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is really pretty and quaint. There are lots of restaurants and coffee shops around the area. Our room was nice and clean. It was nice to have a keurig, microwave, mini fridge, plates, bowls, utensils and dish washing detergent to wash our dishes. It was comforting to go back to our hotel room at the end of the day and be able to relax.The hotel itself looks exactly like the pictures online. It had a sleek and modern environment with a wine hour from 5-6pm on week days. They had one red and white selection. Every guest gets one free glass during this wine hour. The Continental breakfast was great! We stayed in the main building and had to walk to the east building next door to enjoy it but it's not far, worth the walk. There is a wide selection of foods. If you don't want to go to the east building, there are also options in the west building: bread, granola bars, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and fresh fruit. This hotel is pet friendly (bones for them at the entrance) and the staff was very helpful to everyone and very informative. The staff were literally helping people left and right, they were outstanding. Jesse helped us out a lot while we were there and it went completely out of this way to give us a better experience in DC. We would definitely stay here again."

But, this is a hotel I plan to return to. It's just two blocks from the Metro. It's near everything. The Capitol is a short walk away. The Library of Congress is literally across the street. Drawbacks are the lack of restaurants nearby. The hotel has a complimentary breakfast that could benefit from greater variety. Our room had a kitchen area that included a Keurig that was bereft of coffee creamers! Not the full complimentary service expected. All in all, a very nice 'home' away from home."

I flew into Reagan National then took the metro from the airport to the Capitol South station for a total train ride of about 20 minutes that only cost around $3 one way. The hotel was then a pretty easy 2 block walk east from the Capitol South station. The area is mostly residential walk-ups and government office buildings so it is very secure and light traffic in the immediate area. The hotel is directly east of some Congressional offices and south of the Library of Congress and was within walking distance of the Capitol, Supreme Court and a host of other buildings. I walked several times to the Smithsonian area and it wasn't too bad at all, but if you prefer you can take the metro, a cab or use one of the bicycles belonging to the hotel which they will loan you for free.The rooms are pretty spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The room I was in had a small 2 person dining table, sofa and kitchenette area with a full size refrigerator, ice maker, sink, microwave and cooktop in a little nook area. They even provided some dishes, silverware and glassware as well as some pots and pans. It isn't as much as a full sized kitchen, of course, but plenty to let you avoid eating out every meal until you are sick of doing it. To the east there are some shops such as a CVS Pharmacy and an organic produce store where you can buy a few things such as bread, peanut butter, ginger ale, fruit etc. to keep on hand. There is also a farmers market to the east somewhere, but it was closed when I was there. There are also quite a few small places to eat ranging from sushi and thai to more common Subway sandwich shops etc.The hotel also offers a very nice breakfast from 630 to 10 which is advertised as ""continental"" but is actually a good deal nicer than standard continental. It has apple juice, orange juice, coffee, a nice selection of fruit, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, pastries, cereal, milk and at least one type of meat and cheese to pair with your eggs (one day was ham and swiss, while another was salami and provolone). No omelet bar or made to order waffles, but certainly more than mere continental. They even offer a complimentary USA Today and Washington Post (until they run out) in the breakfast area. I was very impressed overall and only had two complaints. First, there was a somewhat raucous party on the first night I arrived which was a Sunday. They finally put away their bongos around 11 though so it was fine I suppose. Second, they seemed a little stingy with the TP and kleenex with hardly any in the room when I arrived and barely ever giving me more than an immediate supply even when requesting more. I would still stay here again, but it just seemed like an odd thing to be stingy with in a nice hotel like this.Overall though an outstanding hotel in a great area that is conveniently located to just about anything you could ever want to do in Washington D.C. for business or pleasure."

Hotel staff was great--allowed early check-in and though I used their valet parking, because it was off-season for high tourism, could have easily street parked right outside the hotel. The free breakfast was a notch up from the usual--croissants, ham, provolone, oatmeal, fruit, muffins--all good stuff. Hotel room was lovely--had the King Suite, which has a very large living room, and thought the Keurig coffee brewer in the kitchenette was a nice touch. Quiet neighborhood at night, so sleeping was easy. Great stay, excellent location, and not as pricey as some other hotels in the area!"

The refurbished decor was well appointed and not bad value, comparatively speaking. especially as a decent continental-style breakfast was included in the tariff. The breakfast dining room is a little cramped but kind of fun, with the sort of conspiratorial chatter and interesting characters that might be expected to be visiting one of the world's most influential capitals. The leafy semi-suburban location is very pleasant and quite handy to government institutions and modestly priced restaurants. It is nice stroll to Union Station where the tourist buses hangout. The friendly and helpful staff made our two day stay particularly memorable. Highly recommended."

I didn't know that my room was located in the next building, but luckily the complimentary continental breakfast was located in this building.

Luckily it did the second time.The room was very simply, but I loved the layout. The room was big and had a huge walk in closet and restroom. Towards the back there was dining area and a small kitchen with a full size refrigerator. The view out the window wasn't the best, but I was only there for one night and had to leave early in the morning so my window shades were closed the entire time.

Would look for another alternatives if we were to visit again DC.We spent 2 nights at the Capitol Hill Hotel in July 2014. We arrived very early and was given a room immediately. Check-in was quick as we had prepaid. The room was spacious and clean with two double beds, a small kitchenette and a bathroom. The air conditioner worked well, bathrobes were provided and although the bathroom was small, the shower was wonderful. An in-room laptop safe was also provided. A small coffee machine was provided in the kitchenette, there was also a microwave available. The artwork in the room was a bit non-sensical, but the bedding and curtains were black and white and pleasant to look at. The television worked well. There was also a desk and chair provided in the room.There are two lifts in the hotel and they are old, small and slow. During busy periods one may wait slightly longer for the lifts to come. We had booked the room through Travel Pony which had offered a significant discount on the room due to us making a first booking with them. Although it had been advertised as room only, we received complimentary continental breakfasts during our stay. The breakfast was served in the second building of the hotel. The breakfast was lovely, but the breakfast room was small and filled up quickly in the mornings. The hotel also offers free iced water, coffee and tea in the library during the day. We struggled a bit with using the wi-fi in the room, but found it much easier in the lobby, library and breakfast room. The location of the hotel is excellent with the Capitol South metro located within 200 metres from the hotel. The library of Congress, Capitol Building and other sights are within walking distance from the hotel. We were there for the 4th of July celebrations and found the location excellent for attending the free concern at the Capitol Building and for viewing the fireworks in the National Mall. There are several shops and restaurants located in the area around the hotel. Check-out was quick and efficient and luggage storage is provided. We found the staff very friendly and accommodating."

Staff was very accommodating, pleasant, and considerate! They gave personal attention to every detail of our stay. Very impressed! Loved the location...closest to Marine Barracks, walk to the Mall, museums, delis, restaurants, the White House, Capitol, Metro, etc. We were so thankful to be given an early check-in after flying a ""red-eye"" flight to DC, and then were given a late check-out to accommodate our departure time. The hotel offers a nice business center where we printed our our boarding passes at no charge. Nice laundry facilities, work-out room, and Breakfast Room as well.We enjoyed our large Queen Deluxe Suite which had modern decor, comfy beds, pillows and linens. It offered a full-size closet/dressing room and full kitchen. The bathroom was clean, nice and had a good shower head with plenty of hot water and pressure. Nice quality soaps/shampoos provided. Air Conditioner worked great and kept us very comfortable. Downsides: The view outside of our window was the back of another building...not great, but we weren't there that much anyway. No table of any kind to sit and eat at, and no privacy curtains or room-darkening shades in our particular room, only a sheer Roman shade.The complimentary breakfast was wonderful...a variety of fresh bagels, with lots of options to top it with....cream cheese, butter, peanut butter, jam or honey. You can also make a nice breakfast sandwich by putting sliced deli meats and real cheese slices on bagels or toast. They had 3 kinds of cereal, whole milk, OJ and Cranberry juice, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, and oatmeal packets. Just don't be late or some items are gone and they put the food away promptly! You'll love this modern, restored hotel in the beautiful historic neighborhood which felt safe and clean. A+ for staff service! Thank you...we'll be back!"

What a great stay! The location was convenient for my business-oriented stay, the meeting venue was nearby and everything was smooth and easy. The hotel has a very pleasant, helpful staff. The wifi was really fast and whenever a little problem occurred with it (my own fault!) or any other help was needed, the helpfull staff was there right away to assist me happily.The hotel had a beautiful lobby and the room was spacious and nicely decorated. The air condition was efficient and the bed was comfortable. And the breakfast was just superb - who needs lunch after it?! If you still do, there are a couple of very nice restaurants just around the block. The neighborhood around the hotel was beautiful as well.It was easy to get a cab if I wished to see the city and the staff was always there to help me get one. The nearest metro station was just around the block. One great thing I really need to mention about this hotel is that the hotel even has a complimentary wine tasting every day at 5PM. Wow, what a service!"

We arrived a little early and took a moment to walk and enjoy the neighborhood. However, when we arrived back at 4:00pm our room was not ready. The man behind the desk (do not recall his name but had a French accent) was very unhelpful and did not seem concerned. Luckily, another gentleman stepped in and was very knowledgeable and explained that they had delays due to housekeeping and the volume of the cherry blossom festival. This was annoying, but at least he had his ducks in a row and did show concern (finally got our room at 4:30).Beyond beginning, we did enjoy the hotel and the location options it offered. The breakfast was a nice surprise, not your typical small hotel size. The other hotel staff members were very polite and helpful and made our stay great. The room size was great for our family of four and the full size refrigerator was a blessing. The hotel's location to the mall and the capital south metro station was a blessing and the ""hill"" neighborhood offered great restaurants and friendly people as well. Overall we enjoyed our time at this hotel and when we return to DC, this will be our first option."

So when we found out this is a dog friendly hotel I jumped at the chance to make a family trip. While making the arrangements months in advance I had told the reservations department we had two large dogs. Both over 50lbs. This they said was not a problem. We were so excited. So the trip was planned. Well the night before I decided, since we were traveling quit a distance, to call and confirm. Well, what started out to be a simple trip almost turned bad! Not only did the front desk keep transferring me to someone else who would then transfer me back to the front desk, that person would then put me on hold. I had to keep hanging up and calling back. The not so nice front desk person on duty then informed me they only took one dog and it had to be 25lbs. So we could take the chance and come down if we wanted too! Well I had all my notes for the original confimation and I informed him we would be coming and they would honor this. Well of course I went on to work on a back of plan if we wound up with no place to stay. I had bought this deal thru TravelZoo and it could not be refunded or used at a different date so off we went. We had plans with family in the area and I was not about to disappoint my nephew, who had been waiting for weeks to see us! We drove down and along the way I figured I would give another try to speaking with someone else and this is where Hichem Aloulou comes in. He promised me he would see to our stay and we would have no trouble. I was the first to go in to the hotel. After the crazy mass confusion of the original reservations and phone calls the night before I was taking no chances. I was alittle unsure of the trustworthiness of this adventure with good cause. Well I was immediately greeted by Hichem Aloulou who knew who I was and he was so pleasant and professional. This whole stay was turned around by the wonderful Manager on Duty Hichem Aloulou. I went out and got my husband, daughter and the 2 dogs. They staff looked alittle unsure as to what was going on at first but then all was well. They warmed up to the dogs after seeing they really are just like little children. We had a wonderful stay and the room was perfect the way it was. All guests with dogs are required to stay on the first floor. These rooms are a one bedroom and a living room with a kitchen. Which by the way is equipped with a sink and dishes. Perfect for us since you have to stay with the dogs in the room we ordered from a local pizza place and had dinner in! They said they are doing renovations and upgrades but this was not a problem at all. Hichem went out of his way to make our stay so pleasant it actually felt as comfortable as being at home. Hichem even brought us up another lamp after I had mentioned I was having a hard time reading because the room was too dark. Everything from bones in the main entrance for the dogs, dog beds, water bowls for the dogs, games for the kids in the lobby toy chest, wine for the adults in the library, breakfast in the morning and an all around feel of sophistication but home town charm! The neighborhood is dog friendly which was great because it gave us a chance to go exploring and see all the history they have to offer. The rest of the staff was wonderful too! We will be back! Please give them a try they really are worth it!"

Reasonably priced.However, the hotel cites a recent complete renovation, really? The bathroom door was broken, beat up, wouldn't even close. Bathtub enamel chipped away, corners of rooms like the rest, look like they have not been attended to in 40 years. The cleaning staff woke us up every half hour (husband ill, so he slept in) by entering our room over and over again. We dead bolted the door finally, not getting the hint; they kept pounding the door through where door caught on the lock. Geniuses. Advertises free wifi, but not once did it work during our stay, kept getting error messages that it was unstable, slow or not available."

The beds, including the sofa bed and complimentary folding bed, were very comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with plates, utensils, glasses, refrigerator, microwave, stove and sink. The kitchen sink was slow to drain. The bathroom was okay, but had a little mold here and there, and the tub was slow to drain. Communal baths are also available down the hall. The room was otherwise very clean, though a little small. Our room overlooked the street, which was nice during the day, but a little bright at night -- even with the shades drawn. There were plenty of easily accessible electrical outlets. For the price, it is a very good room.The breakfast was well above average. The cereal, bagels, pastries and muffins were very good. The boiled eggs were very good. The salami and cheese slices were also very good. Complimentary teas were provided in the room and upon request. Excellent complimentary fruit waters were available in the lobby. The service was exceptional around the clock, including at breakfast. Prompt, very helpful assistance was provided in the Business Center. The staff was very friendly and eager to help. The location near the capitol building is exceptional -- 2 1/2 blocks from the Capitol South Metro station. Despite some minor issues described above, I will stay at this hotel again. There were NO bed bugs in our room, which have become ubiquitous in DC hotels."

There are some negative reviews, but the location was perfect for our needs: incredibly close to Representatives' offices and relatively low cost.At first glance, the hotel entry is a little odd. Immediately inside the door is a sitting area with a small check-in desk further inside. But the staff was immediately friendly and inviting. Check-in was quick and easy. They always greeted us upon return and every morning when we left. I got the impression that they really cared that we were taken care of well. Few times has the staff been so friendly in any location I've stayed.Rooms are spacious and clean. The beds were very comfortable with nice bedding and not-too-firm mattress. My room had several chairs, a desk area and a small kitchenette. The bathroom is probably the biggest shortcoming and the reason this hotel didn't get 5 stars. The bathrooms are very small. The toilet is small, the sink is a pedestal variety. Even the bathtub is smaller than standard. There are shelves above the toilet for some storage, but we all talked about putting the lid down on the toilet before our toiletries fell in. Unlike some reviews, we never ran out of hot water (I spoke with the rest of my party). The water was steaming hot at all times of the day.The cooling (didn't use heat) worked very well. The drapes did a good job of blocking the light. Sleeping was easy at the Capitol Hill, although there was some noise from the hallway outside.The elevators are smallish and slow. Guess what? There are stairs across the hall that work well.The good news is that I never had to wait long for an elevator. Not a great view from the rooms, but also not a view of a brick wall of the building next door.The hotel has a continental breakfast included in the price. It is extensive and tasty for a continental breakfast. It is served in the second building, not the main building. However, walking to it was no big deal, although during inclement weather it might not be the best.The Capitol Hill Hotel is one block from the Metro, one block from Cannon House Office Building and within two blocks of any of the Library of Congress buildings. You can walk to the Capitol steps in about five minutes, as well as any of the House office buildings. The Senate are a little further, but it's still closer and faster to walk than to take the Metro to Union Station - maybe a ten minute walk.The organization I work for decided we will put this hotel at the top of our list when we return. It's not as elegant as some other hotels, but it's price and location are unbeatable. If you have business on the hill and are looking for a nice, affordable, conveniently-close hotel, look no further."

I decided to stay at the Capitol Hotel due to meetings in the area. What a find! The hotel is in a wonderful neighborhood in the Capitol Hill area, with streets lined with lovely brownstones and restaurants. The hotel is off the main drag of Pennsylvania Ave, so it's very quiet in the neighborhood. That said, one block away the area is bustling with sites and restaurants. A perfect location.The room itself was quite comfortable and large. I had a corner room with views out two windows and two different streets. The bedding was nice, and there was plenty of room to work. The bathroom was sufficient and there was the convenience of a small kitchenette just off the bath area. The only complaint is that there wasn't much sink space in the bathroom, but with the small kitchenette area just off to the side (with full length mirror), this made up for the lack of space in the bathroom itself.The front desk service was wonderful, and there is a very nice lounge area off the main lobby with nice seating, coffee, tea and juices. There is also a light breakfast served here in the morning which included muffins. The largest morning breakfast is served in building right next door so even though you have to go outside, it is just steps away (I didn't take advantage of the breakfast service, only the morning muffins, which were delicious).  I would definitely stay here again if in the Capitol Hill area!"

The bathrooms are a little on the small side but adequate.It has since been remodeled, the furnishings are nicer, but the bathroom was still on the small side. I also didn't care for the lighting in the bathroom, but everything else is so great that I didn't mind. It is certainly within walking distance of the Capital, the Library of Congress, the Rayburn Building, and a few of the museums. The metro stop is a block away.There are old town houses across the street and in the neighborhood. We were told that decades ago this is where many congressmen would stay. It is a nice neighborhood, but not fancy like Dupont Circle.There is a market and a variety of restaurants down the block.A cab driver told us that when Congress is in session, this hotel is often sold out, and there is heavy security even in the hotel.Breakfast is adequate, we had wi-fi, and you can't be the atmosphere.There are a few restaurants around the cornerThis hotel is very close to the main attractions (we walked and used the subway) and the room was really big, with a comfortable bedroom, large livingroom and a full kitchen. They were renovating when we stayed there, so the breakfast was ""to go"". There is also parking for an extra fee.Very friendly staff too."

Couldn't be more helpful. Valet service was efficient & check-in was straightforward. Professional, super friendly attitudes from all we encountered.- Secure, safe building on a pretty, tree-lined Washington street.Loved it and would definitely recommend to anyone going to Washington.Suites are great for families and this hotel has 152 of them. Each room has a separate living room with pull out couch and flat screen. The living room furniture is a bit worn but they are changing that in November 2012. Bed was very comfy. My bathroom was very homey but I would like to have had a larger shelf or something to put my toiletries bag on. Great location - close to subway, Union Station, Starbucks. Free breakfast that offered a large spread that included a lot of great looking fresh fruit. Only downside is that the breakfast is served in one of their 2 buildings and there is no connecting hallway which would require a cold walk if you weren't staying in the right building. This hotel is a recommend and I would bring my family. DISCLOSURE: I was a guest of the hotel management. My opinion is my own and meant to help families choose a hotel that is right for them."

The location was convenient since I was in Washington on a research trip to the Library of Congress & this hotel was directly across the street! The Metro subway stop was a short 2 blocks away so it was easy to get to the Smithsonian & the National Mall. It was walking distance from Capitol Hill. The complimentary continental breakfast contained a variety of foods so that even though I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights, I never had to have the same breakfast twice. The staff was very friendly & greeted me each time I left the hotel. The only minor flaw was that there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom of my otherwise perfect suite (complete with kitchenette, sink, fridge, microwave and queen size bed). I would definitely be back if I was ever in DC again."

Breakfast was included and consisted of fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereals, pastries, juices, teas and coffees. The breakfast room was located in the second block which was only 20 metres from main reception. The only small negative was that the breakfast room was on the small side and seating was limited and on occasion we did have to wait for a table."

Upon our arrival we have been informed that they have no room for us! They put us in a room for 2 people, with one king bed, despite us being 4 grown ups. They did not even apologize, actually the receptionist was extremely rude about it. Then they delivered an extra SINGLE roll-in bed to us, on which i could feel every spring pinching into my ribs, and we had to ask for sheets and pillows because apparently it is not clear we need a pillow to sleep. My brother, meanwhile, had to SLEEP ON THE TINY 2-seat SOFA. Plus,they gave us no blankets, just a thin cloth, and the room was FREEZING and extremely MOIST despite being in the middle of July, so we were uncomfortable and cold all through the night. Getting a bed is literally the minimum you expect from any hotel when you book it. I have no idea how something like this can even happen when you prepay a room in full. We were shocked not only by the poor accomodation, but also by the attitude of the staff. We had to ask the manager for a new room and a refund the following morning (they themselves didn’t seem to think we deserve any of those). They only gave us 50% off the first night, but I do acknowledge the effort. Granted, they also threw in a free Uber ride to the station upon our request. As of yet, we still have not received a proper apology. Plus, they were renovating and neglected to inform us, so the hotel was under construction and there was sooo much moisture that our bed was wet! We were very cold. Our room was supposed to have a garden view, but it was overlooking a construction site. Overall, a horrible experience. We expected a lot more from a 8,2 Booking.com and 3* rated hotel!"

The weekend there was very little foot traffic and quiet which was great. Once Monday hit it was a very busy area but we weren't bothered by it. The staff was very courteous and accommodating from the beginning. Finding the front desk was interesting since they still are under construction for renovations. But we were able to leave our bags there until check in and check in was easy and quick.Even through construction we slept well but was discouraging because not everything was available to us at this visit. We had to use the back entrance of the hotel which meant we had to walk around the block to get to the metro. Again, not bad because it is seriously maybe not even 5 minutes from the metro.The bathroom was great and loved the mirror that they had above the sink. The shower was nice as well. The whole feel of the room was very modern and pretty. The only thing was their towels were so new that they were still leaving fuzz all over you as you were toweling off. Not a big deal but that is how new they seemed.The TV was a little off but not a big deal either unless that is what you like as part of a hotel room. It had issues with the connectivity and it would randomly shut off and go to the main menu instead of the show/news we were watching.Beds and the awesome and numerous amounts of pillows on each bed were amazing!The Keurig and fridge were much appreciated and welcome every day!Overall, it was a fun stay but would wait to go back once they are done with the renovation! Although it probably will increase their prices but if you go with multiple people it's not as pricey."

Arc the hotel in Washington DC.,"This hotel needs major work. First of all they did not tell us that they were under construction and so we had to come thru the side entrance which had garbage and construction machinery and vehicles. Someone then put yellow tape as a precaution. They mention parking but there is no parking at this hotel. They have street parking but park in the wrong spot and you will get towed away. Since they are fixing up the place, all the amenities were also under construction. The room it self was nice, it was clean and updated but the heating system was not working properly. The walls were freshly painted but could have used a second coat you could tell the did a rush job. The walls are super thin since this is an older hotel. We stayed at the top floor and were kept up all night by the young college kids. George Washington university is right around the corner. On the positive side, it's located in a safe quiet tree lined neghiborhood. Old brownstones with small gardens out front give the area a cozy feel. Overall I will not be staying here again. Yes it's near the metro subway and buses but it's not a family hotel. If you can get a good rate to stay overnight and you have no other choice then I would consider the hotel across the street first before this place.This is the 300 $ per day ‘s room they sold to us. We realize that we lived in construction site for three days . They gave fake ad on website , the front desk lying all the time. Terrible experience. Waste my time and money and trust."

Initially I looked at the inn because of its proximity to the blue line (5 minute maximum walk from the Foggy Bottom GWU stop). What got me to book this inn instead of some of the surrounding hotels was the ambiance and the amazing price. Upon arrival Marcus was very pleasant and helpful. We had a wonderful room with 2 queen beds which had more than enough space for us to spread out all of our suitcases and clothing. There was a fridge and a microwave as well as a coffee maker in the room which we put to good use with leftovers. Despite being near a hospital the noise from traffic was minimal.The package we booked included breakfast every day and I would highly recommend it. The breakfast included 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, toast and either potatoes or fruit. It was served in the restaurant downstairs and was great each of the 3 mornings we ate there. The inn has 2 computers in a ""business center"" for public use. Unfortunately something came up with work and I did not have my laptop so in the midst of our trip I needed to get on the computer, type a document and send it through email. The computers were slightly slower than my maximum speed at home but very functional for what I was trying to do. The hotel is right at the metro blue line as I mentioned earlier but it is also easily within walking distance for reasonably mobile individuals. I am in no way a gym person but I was happy to walk from the hotel to the White House. For the more adventurous walkers we also walked all the way to the Smithsonian museums and the Mall which was a trek but very fun and doable with good weather. It is also close to a number of restaurants by foot and by metro. There is a 7eleven around the corner if you forget something and a Whole Foods by the metro station. The entire staff of the inn were very helpful. The few times I called the front desk with requests (plastic silverware once and more towels once) they were quick to respond to my requests. I plan on staying here regularly for my trips to DC."

Lots of walking, but so worth it. We were located about 7 minutes from the Metro (subway) in Foggy Bottom area. The Inn is in the Foggy Bottom area. Just a few blocks away was the very neat Georgetown shopping and restaurants. Amazing stores .... all in old, historical buildings. People walk everywhere. And as the fabulous kicker.... we were like 5 minutes from the Kennedy Center - which was incredible to see; and the Watergate. Then beyond that, maybe 10 min. walk is the Washington Waterfront area...full of really neat places to eat, have cocktails - right on the water/Potomac River. I can't say what a great location this Inn is in. And now for the staff - VERY friendly, helpful in every way, called us by our names whenever they saw us...namely Beau (behind the desk)...see photo.... - he was terrific. And a Driver - Mamboo - so friendly, so courteous. We would not stay anywhere else in WA DC when we go back again. Our room was on 7th floor overlooking darling, colorful row houses, and a bridge over the Potomac River. There is an upscale restaurant attached to hotel - and a little bar.

Nice, comfortable, convenient option","We headed to downtown Washington D.C. for the day and I was looking for somewhere that would give us walkability in the city. As with any city, the closer you are to the center the more expensive the hotel. I really like the Georgetown area and was excited to find deal on bookit.com for George Washington Inn and less than $100 for the night. This was great since having a hotel within walking distance would allow us to avoid excess parking fees. The deal with bookit.com came to a grand total of $116 including hotel rate, taxes, and free parking. When we arrived on Saturday morning around 11am we weren't sure what to do with the car so we pulled into the drive. GWI is located in a somewhat residential location in Foggy Bottom so there were no parking lots and pretty full street parking. I ran inside to find out the details and she said I could go ahead and pull my car up to the garage and leave it there and that they already had a room available for us. The lobby was small but open and pristine and there was a table with cookies, candy, and a flavored water pitcher throughout the time we were there. The bellman helped us take our bags out of the car and carried them to our room for us.The room was a great surprise, it was HUGE. We walked in to a very spacious living room with small kitchen, table and chairs, desk for computers, sleeper sofa and arm chair and television inside the armoir. The kitchen included a refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and all dishes and utensils. The bedroom off of the living room was also spacious and had a huge king bed right in the middle as well as a tv and full-size closet. The bathroom was older but in great shape and roomy enough. Even the extra toilet paper was wrapped in green ribbon.We chose this hotel because it was a little over a mile from the National Mall and that was the reason we were there. After checking in we started our trek and arrived at the mall around 1pm. We had such a great time and I was so grateful that we didn't have to worry about limited parking or paying to park at all. After a full day, around 8pm, we walked from the Lincoln Memorial back to the hotel to look up places to get some food. We asked for a recommendation at the front desk but he gave us the name of a casual restaurant and we were so worn out we really just wanted fast food. It turns out there were quite a few restaurants within a few block radius so we settled on the college campus Potbelly just two blocks away and bought a 2-liter at the attached campus convenience store. Down the stairs from Potbelly was also a whole food court. We took the food back to the room and had a comfortable night's sleep before the long drive home in the morning.At check-out they wanted to charge me for parking even though it came free with the reservation but they weren't hasty and said they would look into it. I called a couple of days later and between that and a simple email communication with bookit.com, the issue was resolved and we were not charged for the parking. I think this was just an error in the translation of the 3rd party booking.I would definitely recommend this as a clean, comfortable, and convenient place to stay when visiting DC attractions. Even DC cupcakes was only a mile away in the other direction but we never had time to go there."

Restaurant and bar has good food and wine but was visited by noisy Aussies from time to time.The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood by George Washington University. It’s a short walk from the Foggy Bottom Metro which is very convenient. We had two families, so one couple had a Traditional King Room and the other couple with a child had a King Suite. The reservations were made separately, but they were able to accommodate us and have the rooms right next to each other. We chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced for a suite with a bedroom you could close off. It worked out perfectly. The King Suite also had a kitchenette. While we never cooked on it, it was nice to have for grabbing breakfasts in the morning. The only incident we had was with the magnetic strips on the keys not working. After multiple visits to the front desk, they got them to work. This was somewhat irritating after a long day of touring when we just wanted to go to bed!"

Its location just a couple blocks from the metro stop at the corner of GWU made getting to and from the airport an inexpensive breeze, as well as providing handy access to American U and sights like Arlington and the Mall (although one evening we walked back to the hotel after a self-guided walking tour of the monuments). The facilities are limited -- no pool or fancy lobby, but the attached restaurant Notti Bianche was a nice choice for our pre-concert dinner before walking just a few blocks to the Kennedy Center. The front desk clerk was helpful in arranging our dinner reservations when Open Table claimed to have no tables at our desired time, and we were always greeted by the bellmen and front desk clerks upon arriving and departing throughout our visit. Many other options for dining in the area, and we found healthy choices at the nearby Whole Foods to stock up for breakfast, and store in the handy fridge. The rates were very reasonable for the location, and I would recommend to anyone looking to stay in this part of D.C."

It is situated in a pleasant, leafy district among George Washington University buldings and historic houses which, since we visited at the end of October, were charmingly decorated with pumpkins on their steps. You exit the metro at Foggy Bottom into a small park, nestling between university buildings. Turn right, cross the road, turn left and the hotel is a few hundred yards on the right. The first thing you see is the Italian restaurant and the hotel is down a short drive. There is room for about 7 cars on the drive and in the small garage. The lobby is smart and welcoming, and check-in was efficient. Our second floor room faced the front of the hotel and the drive and the view was of the rear of the houses along New Hampshire Avenue. We felt we had truly arrived in Washington when we were told that the building we could just see to the right was part of the infamous Watergate complex! The room was large and had 2 comfy queen beds and plenty of warm bedding - far too much as it turned out since the weather was warm. There was a welcome armchair and extremely comfy large revolving desk chair on wheels at the good-sized desk. A built-in wardrobe with sliding doors was by the entrance door and it contained an easy to use safe that would have been a challenge for a short person to reach but was no problem for my 5' 10"" husband. There was a large TV concealed behind a unit, which we kept concealed since the warnings we'd been given about how awful American TV is proved correct! The kitchen area doubled up as a dressing room and contained a good size fridge, a small freezer, a microwave and coffee machine with 2 mugs that dispensed tea or coffee by filtering hot water through a tea or coffee bag. I'd never come across a coffee bag before. If you like your coffee fairly strong I recommend putting some instant coffee in the mug and allowing the water to filter onto it. Just to the left of the metro station you can see the wonderful Whole Foods Supermarket where you can buy milk, cereal, fresh fruit salad, croissants, etc for breakfast. It also has a huge salad bar and sells beautiful pastries, bread, cakes, etc along with the usual supermarket goods. Back at the hotel, the bathroom, though small, was well stocked with towels and pleasant toiletries and there were nice touches like the ribbon around the spare toilet roll. There was plenty of hot water and the pressure in the shower over the bath was good. We were unlucky in that there were roadworks outside during our stay but I would imagine that usually this is a fairly quiet road for central Washington. There were net and blackout curtains, so no problem there. The only improvements I would have made were that the pillows, while comfortable, were small and square, unlike those we are used to, and it would have been helpful to have had a small work surface in the kitchen area, and a kettle. We didn't have much interaction with the staff since the hotel doesn't serve breakfast but Reception readily produced a bottle opener so we could enjoy a cold beer in our room one evening and a nice touch was the staff pumpkin carving competition in the lobby(see photo!) I'm in my late 50s, overweight and no great walker but I had no problem walking to the White House, Lincoln Memorial and other wonderful monuments and museums along the Mall, from the hotel. We would definitely stay here again."

This hotel was already reasonably priced for D.C. and then we were offered a free upgrade when we booked our room. Staff was very helpful and friendly. We ate buffet breakfast every morning in the attached restaurant. Good variety of scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, fruit, muffins, bagels, and breads. The hotel isn't fancy, but was a welcome sight every night after very long days of sight-seeing. The area was semi-residential and seemed pretty safe even at night, including the Metro. We bought the Metro pass and toured the city all week, from one end to the other without any problems. The Metro got really crowded during peak hours, so we adjusted our schedule to avoid the working crowds. We walked for miles to see all the monuments and other attractions and would not recommend renting a car because of parking issues. We memorized the Metro routes quickly and learned to jump on and off to get around. We took in a couple of tours including a great night tour on the Old Town Trolley. Overall it was a great stay and a great choice of a hotel - we would definitely stay here again."

This one is beautiful as a bonus. Eddie checked us in at the desk and helped us so much with maps, the metro, and lunch and dinner information and recommendations. It is a well-cared for old building. The sink and tub are antiques surrounded by new touches of furnishings, decor, and materials. We LOVED the dispensers in the shower for shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner: no tiny bottles for trash or recycling! We didn't even open the package of round hand soap! It was an environmental touch we really appreciated. The sheets and towels are good quality and there were lots of channels on the flat screen. I would stay again and again."

After some persistence we found the GWU Inn that seemed to be a good price and had good reviews. We stayed 3 nights and were very pleased with the service and rooms provided by the hotel. We found that we had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was very spacious with a large living area, kitchenette and a separate bedroom with king bed. Our room looked out toward Georgetown and the Potomac and over the residential neighbourhood. We also looked at the Watergate Hotel we discovered where we found a Safeway grocery store with good supplies for breakfast and a couple of meals when we were too tired from all the museums and monuments). The exterior of the hotel and the lobby are plain and modest but the room was clean, well appointed and well equipped. It was an easy walk to Georgetown to all the boutiques and bars as well as the metro which took us in no time to the mall and the major attractions. At night it was quiet and the area surrounding the hotel was very safe. On top of all this it was good value for money. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Washington and at the GWU Inn and will be recommending this to other Australian friends."

As other reviewers have noted, it is an odd arrangement due to its former life as a dorm/apartment structure and has no real lobby area. The rooms vary widely in size. The guest services offered (breakfast, business center, gym, pool) appear to be rather limited but I didn't seek them out either. The staff was pleasant, no problems at all during my stay. By far the best aspect to this hotel is its proximity to GWU and the Metro Blue-Yellow Line Foggy Bottom-GWU stop which is less than a block away and offers great access to the rest of the area including a short non-transfer ride to Washington National Airport. It took me 15 minutes at a steady pace to walk from the hotel to the Lincoln Memorial at the west end of the National Mall. A large umbrella is included in the closet for use during your stay which I thought was a great touch given the problems carrying large umbrellas on flights. The bathroom of my room was small but co-workers reported more spacious bathrooms in their rooms. If a lot bathroom counter space is important to you, then ask, mine barely had a shelf for my bath items. The shower head is a simple 3-stream head and unfortunately is fixed in place, though it is at least located high on the shower wall rather than at face level as I've seen at other properties. A 7-11 store is nearby for small items. The neighborhood and travel path to the National Mall appeared quite safe, I had no concerns walking the area or taking the Metro late at night in this area. Parking (if you wanted to do such a thing) is valet only. The cab ride from Washington National was $19 and took less than 15 minutes in the late evening. I would consider other properties in the area as well when planning a trip but certainly look forward to staying here again."

I chose this hotel for the good rate and was pleasantly surprised. Although our room (King bed) was small that can be expected in any large city. It came with a good-sized mini-frig, microwave and coffee pot. The bathroom was small but adequate. Probably could use a bit up updating, but I was fine with it. The bed was a King and very comfortable. The AC worked great, but a bit noisy as all those types of units are. I just kept the fan on continuously and you get used to it. I really appreciated how well it worked since it was so hot and humid outside.The breakfast is included in the price and includes all the typical American fare--bread, bagels, cereal, yogurt, waffle maker and the likes. I eat grain free so its always a challenge to eat out, but there were scrambled eggs and sausage available, as well as some hard boiled eggs in the refrigerator with the yogurt. I wish they would put out hard boiled eggs in the shell (real eggs). The pre-peeled eggs have that weird flavor to them. There was also fresh fruit such as whole bananas and apples. Of course, hot coffee and tea. There were several big groups staying at the hotel and they seemed to be picked up by their bus at 8am, so I would suggest either eating close to 7am or waiting till after 8am. Even with the large groups dining, they moved right along so not much of a wait. The location was good for us. Just a few blocks over and there were some nice restaurants. One block away is a nice market filled with whatever you need. There are usually taxis parked out front. We did take one to Adams Morgan but he needed our help finding it! From then on we took an Uber. No problems there. They just go where their phones tell them to go. There is free wifi, but it works sporadically. I would stay here again if we visit our daughter!"

I know they're trying to appeal to the business man/woman by putting a desk in the room, but honestly it's just too much furniture for such a small room. Besides, there no outlet to plug in any device anywhere near the desk, so unless your laptop or device is fully charged, it's useless, not to mention the chair is in the way should your companion need to use the bathroom while tour sitting at it. An outlet by the room door, and between the beds on the night stand and that was it. The one on the nightstand was convenient as it had two outlets, plus two USB ports for charging devices. Refrigerator started to freeze contents after they had been in there a while, but the setting knob was all the way up. So if you use it, I'd suggest a setting of 4/5 and not 6. No freezer in that fridge by the way.No microwave in room. Something I take for granted everywhere else. And should have noticed in missing from the room description. But that meant the microwave meals I brought to save eating out all the time were a wasted effort and just meant there was something else to haul back to the car when leaving.Bathroom like the room itself was small, but again, did it's job. Tub and some towels could have been cleaner though.Staff was friendly and even helped me out when I realized I had forgotten my shave cream at home. Something ALL other places I've stayed at would have gladly over charged me for, so a big thanks on that one.Room faced 13th street and there seemed to be an emergency vehicle going down the road every half hour/ hour so prepare for that. I'm sure it's one of the main roads used around that area. Maybe it was because it was a weekend, but the noise can be a bit bothersome when trying to sleep. We didn't get mad, as we figured it's a big city and your going to have a lot of noise when in a big city. I'm sure unless your off a main road your going to hear that regardless of where you stay in DC though. But maybe ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. They do offer ear plugs.Breakfast room wasn't bad. Good selection of drinks/juices. The typical breakfast cereals and muffins. Toaster with slices of bread and bagels. Waffle maker is real popular of course. Only complaint there would be that the sausage and eggs were not kept hot enough. I don't think there was any means of keeping them warm and they both would have been great if they had been. Pretty sure that's a big risk letting them sit out and get cold like that. Something management needs to look into before someone gets ill.I luckily found on street parking not but a block away, so that saved on the valet service, which would have cost me $70+ for the weekend, but that is what I called a miracle at the time. Finding parking in DC that you can leave a car in for two days is rare. I got lucky and it was the weekend, but I had to leave the hotel earlier than I wanted because of the restrictions on that parking space. I would NOT count on that happening to you. I would have used Valet parking actually and was quit prepared for the cost, BUT after circling the block a dozen times (and that's no joke or over exaggeration there) I could not get a spot in front of the hotel to use valet parking. I was about to call the desk to ask how the heck does one park for the valet when every time I pass the front of the building that spot is taken. Very frustrating to say the least and I was starting to regret I chose this place when circling the building over and over. So I'd prepare for that on busy parts of the day.Most reviews said it was within a 10 to 15 minute walking distance to the White House, but I'd say it's closer to 20/25 unless your young and can walk fast. Walking back from that area is also an uphill walk, so be prepared for that. Nothing real steep and not all the way, but it would make a difference to someone with disabilities or out of shape. There are some places to eat within walking distance. Most places we ate at were within a five to ten minute walk."

He not only booked the additional night for us, but he honored the Booking.com rate and we were able to stay in the same room. The hotel is located in a former apartment building and has a historical designation. The rooms are small but adequate. The entire building and our room was extremely clean. The complimentary hot breakfast was very good and was served in a comfortable updated room. They offer complimentary coffee, tea, hot chocolate and lemon water in the lobby. I will definitely stay here again when in DC."

I was put in a room tucked back in a small hall to the left of the check in desk. It was right on the street so I did get some street noise as well as noise from people checking in/out. The room was tiny but I don't expect much of lower priced city hotels. I happened to be in the lobby a few times when the same person on another floor came down repeatedly complaining of bugs. She had a dead one in her bed and then moved rooms and apparently had another issue in another room. The next morning I woke up to 11 bites to my face and body. I did show the person at the front desk and he apologized but didn't offer to do anything about it. I applied cortisone & antibiotic ointment but the bites took a full 2 weeks to go away. Makeup couldn't even hide them because of the swelling & because I was traveling for work, I didn't have time to seek medical attention which was quite embarrassing to explain to people. While the location of this hotel is good & I am a Choice Privileges member, I would stay elsewhere based on my experience. I have attached photos to my review."

There was also a selection of bread, muffins, cereal, fruit, etc. There were also waffle makers. The location is good, convenient to the convention center. The TV was good and the selection of channels was very good. There is an in-room safe, which is important to me. The bathroom was clean and the towels were soft. My room overlooked the street and was very quiet. The location is good, about 5 blocks to the convention center, 3/4 mile to the White House and about 1.5 mile to the Mall.The wi-fi in 409 was very slow when I checked in, about 7.30 PM. It was better but still slow at 5 AM the next day. However, it was usable to read the news and do emails.

Then in 7-8 minutes walk you have a metro stop with a direct connection to Arlington and the Reagan Airport. In the area there are a lot restaurants, Starbucks and a big Whole Food market where you can find everything you want to eat. The hotel itself has no frills, but it's surely comfortable. Although the room wasn't the biggest around, it was full equipped and the bed was really good, I slept wonderfully there. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The wifi connection was working fine and fast. Breakfast is served in a pleasant room downstairs, you have a good selection of different kind of food to chose from, there's something foe every taste. I loved the waffles I could make myself at the moment with a waffle-maker, soooo delicious. Another positive addiction is the free coffee in the lobby.

BTW - the closest Metro is .66 miles away, and it's uphill (not steep) coming back to the hotel. Dantise had great ideas, like a 4 hour night tour what was excellent. Dantise had the personality that all hotel clerks should have. She made our stay so nice. One elevator was broken so that made the stairs necessary to use."

When we arrived, there was only one staff member at the front desk, and the person ahead of us was checking in a group of teens. We waited patiently while the employee checked in this group, took payment for items some of the kids were buying in the shop, and dealt with a knocked-over glass jar of liquid that left a mess on the floor of the small lobby area. One of the two 5-person capacity elevators was out of order. Since our room was on the eighth floor, walking up with our luggage wasn't an option. We did use the stairs during most of our stay.The room itself was decent, if a big crowded. The windows had blackout shades, though a bit of light leaked through around the edges. We were at the rear of the hotel so didn't get any street noise; however, the AC could have been quieter. We did not hear much noise from other guests coming and going. The King room had a comfy bed, fridge, desk with chair, nice TV, full-length mirror, bedside tables, and good reading lights attached to the headboard. The bathroom was clean, but the only place to hang towels was on a rack in the tub; and there was no vent. The towels are minimalist, but clean.Breakfast was typical Comfort Inn fare. I would like to see some more healthful options, such as whole wheat bread and bagels. Orange and cranberry juices were depleted the first morning we were there.The location is good. If you enjoy walking and are not in a rush, you need not take a car or public transportation. We walked to all the major landmarks from the hotel. (My pedometer recorded 13 miles one day!) There are restaurants, take-out food establishments and services within walking distance. The area seemed safe.Now, the reason for my title: we left DC on Sunday morning and, when we arrived at our destination that evening, I discovered I had left my robe on the bed at the hotel. It is white and blended in with the sheets, so I didn't see it when I packed my luggage that morning. I called the hotel and spoke with a female. I told her when we had left and which room we had occupied. She took my contact information and said she would call me back. I never heard from her. When we returned home a few days later, I called again and spoke with Raj. He took my information and called back saying he had checked with housekeeping and laundry and no one had seen my robe. He left a message the following day, saying he had checked himself and did not find it. I do take responsibility for leaving the robe; however, I am confident it did not grow feet and walk away on its own. If the housekeeper did not notice it, and it got wrapped up in the sheets, the on-premises laundry worker should have come across it. I suspect that one of the employees is now the proud owner of my perfect travel robe.The photos were taken with my phone so the lighting isn't very good."

The hotel is located in a more residential neighborhood whereas over one street on 14th, it had a more commercial feel. Felt safe walking around. The hotel is small but kept up well. We had a decent corner room on the 5th floor and loved it, had a city scape view. Small rooms but after touring all day, it's not like we felt like leaping about the room. There is a firehouse down the street. You will hear them but it wasn't a deal-buster. Big TV, wireless worked great. Bathrooms were neat and tidy. Beds were comfortable. The elevators are small and a bit slow at breakfast time. Breakfast was fine. The typical food they always serve. Just don't go right at opening. The place was mobbed. Wait a half hour and you'll have a much better experience. More seating and fully stocked. All the employees I dealt with were polite and personable, efficient, like they wanted to be there. For the money, this is a good, little hotel. It's not a big, opulent place but I'd certainly go back. You can walk to tourist stuff easily if you're somewhat an active person. We walked to the tidal basin and back and it was a pretty good hoof but we're walkers. You'll be fine here. Utilize the Circulator for certain neighborhoods. From Union Station to 13th and K, it took us 25 minutes and cost $1.50. A taxi will run you $18.00. We walked easily (with small suitcases) from the bus stop a few blocks north to the hotel.

I have rarely stayed at a place where everyone was as keen as these people to make sure I was happy.It is also in a fantastic location: four blocks from the convention center. An easy walk to the National Mall or public transportation.But here's the let down: the rooms. OK, they're small. Not a deal breaker. But they're dismal. I couldn't tell if the carpet and bedding were old, or just not well kept. The wallpaper was scarred, peeling, and bubbling - not just in the bathroom, but the main room, too. The paint on the bathroom ceiling was bubbling: the sign of painted over mold. Then there's the smell. The first day it just seemed stale. But as the days progressed, my room had a growing sense of damp. A colleague had an even worse odor in his room. Another oddity was the placement of the hair dryer - right over the sink. One last oddity - a lamp on the desk wouldn't work and i assumed it was the bulb. Investigating a couple of days later, I discovered that it wasn't plugged in ... as there was no outlet anywhere near the lamp.The positives ... the bed was very comfortable. And the lounge/dining area in the basement was well decorated.The pictures on the hotel's website were obviously taken the day the renovations were completed - however many years ago that was. This could be an excellent place to stay. But it isn't."

Valet parking is available but quite expensive - we had little choice with a hire car as options are few - but were able to access this at any time of the day/night.Rooms are comfortable but very small & our king size bed (which was extremely comfortable) took up most of the space, making it a tight fit around existing furniture & our large suitcases & extra bags. Having said that ... who stays in a room longer than necessary when there's so much to see in DC?!The bathroom is also quite small but very clean & seviceable. It's located within an easy 20 minute walk of the White House....with many restaurants, museums, sights & monuments also within walking distance of the hotel...DC we found was an easy town to traverse by foot ...(see review on walking tours)Breakfast was a help yourself arrangement downstairs in a modern & recently re-furbished basement dining room with funky furniture & several tv's - cereals, yoghurt & fruit, hot scrambled eggs, bacon, toast & waffles...not gourmet but great when included in the price! We appreciated the provision of guest laundry facilities downstairs to wash & dry clothes during our stay too....not often an option in city hotels - coin operated & cheap. Overall we enjoyed our stay in this affordable hotel & loved our time in Washington DC - a fabulous city we hope to re-visit one day!"

We were too early to check in. The only parking for this hotel is valet which is 5 blocks away @ $30 a day. We left to look for a store and found a deli a few blocks past the hotel. We returned to the hotel the rooms were still not ready. We asked if we could just unpack the car and park it. At this point they went out of there way to find us are rooms. We would have been happy to just get rid the car. The staff was very accommodating.The hotel is in the process of a face lift. It is a work in progress. Our rooms had new furniture and sm refrigerators were in the hallway just waiting to be put in. A nice young gentleman named Kyle helped us with our luggage and hook up the refrigerators. He was friendly and helpful as we later found out all the staff where. He filled us in on the up dates to the hotel & told us about the free breakfast on the lower floor. The breakfast/ lounge area could also be used to relax & enjoy a BYO cocktail. He also told us about the night guided tour of the monuments. We took his advice and went on the tour @ $37 each on an ac bus in 99 degree heat it sounded good to us. Kyle did not steer us wrong. The bus picked us up @ the hotel @ 7pm & returned us @ 10:30 we made several stop before the tour started the bus was full. Our room was smaller than our friend’s room maybe because it was a corner room. The good thing it was clean, the beds & pillows were comfortable & the ac worked great in both rooms. It had all the usual amenities & a clock radio with an Ipod dock all room had free wifi.Everyday after touring we would return to Noemil’s smiling faces the desk clerk asking about our day. Complimentary coffee, lemon aid & if you hit it right delicious cookies were in the lobby along with & computer & printer to use. We could not see how anyone could complain about the free breakfast buffet. They had it all coffee, tea, juice, fruit, scramble & hard boiled eggs, sausage, yogurt, pastries & breads, hot & cold cereal & milk. And of course make your own waffles. The room was full but there was plenty.It is about 5 blocks from the McPherson subway. We had a pleasant stay and if in the area we would stay again.

BIG mistake. The room was cramped and not very clean, the curtains were falling off the window on one side, and it was never fixed. Every time we called to ask for something, the front desk replied with, ""we don't have anyone to bring/do that."" Our refrigerator request was all but ignored, despite several groups checking out the first few days of our stay. The heating/cooling unit was under the window, and the bed was placed so that the person in that bed was freezing while the room remained warm. There was no fan in the bathroom, which made the Wash DC humidity even more unbearable. The bathroom window opened, but we had to use a phone book to keep it open for ventilation. The room was the smallest I've seen in a while. Two full beds with enough walkway between, and half that much on either side. The small armoire and desk and dresser took up the rest of the room almost completely. To make matters worse, the lobby consisted of a sofa in the small room where the computer was kept. So there was no where to escape for queit(er) time. The continental breakfast was ok. Lots of carbs. The make your own waffles were good, but more than one a week would have been too much. The hard boiled eggs got old fast. I would rather have had a better room and paid for breakfast. The breakfast room would have been a great place to escape the room during the day, except that it was locked, except for breakfast. We got stuck in the elevator twice, and the front desk didn't seem concerned at all. The location was okay, walking distance to bus stops and tour bus stops. The walls were thin, and facing the street, we heard every frequent siren, and boy are there a lot of them in DC! Overall, I cannot recommend this hotel at all. This hotel can charge what it does because all the hotels are overpriced, not because it is worth it. Spend a little more and pay for breakfast, you'll be glad you did."

And because of the way the room layed out I had windows on 3 walls, and even a window in the bathroom (rare), which makes the room feel less like a hotel and more open. The hotel was walking distance to all of the nations capital historic monuments, and next to great restaurants. The continental breakfast had a variety of everything, and very tasty. $120 well spent, this place is a perfect for those who don't want to spend a fortune on hotels only a few blocks away. I booked through Hotels.com."

This hotel was chosen because we have a Choice Hotel Rewards card and this was the closest Choice Hotel. We flew into Reagan National and had Super Shuttle deliver us so we had no car to worry about. Like previous visitors, we also found hauling our one suitcase up the stairs to the check in desk a bit difficult. There is no ramp so I don’t know how a handicapped person would maneuver this hotel. During check in I jokingly asked the clerk, Fifi, if she was giving us a great room. She coldly asked me if I requested a quiet room ahead of time. So much for the joking around! We soon found that the room was neither quiet nor great. Comfort Inn Downtown sits on the corner of M and 13th Street NW. The closest metro station is on I and 14th which is four blocks south and one block west. Other than the occasional prostitute or crazy, there is no problem walking on the streets, which are clean and well maintained. The crossings at each corner are timed so you know exactly how much time you have to cross the street. There is never a long wait since the lights change frequently. True, there is a fire station down the street but none of the fire trucks we saw ever came from that station, which was a bit of a mystery to us. The Hard Rock café is on 10th street and F Street so it is a bit of a walk on a hot day. Likewise The Mall is on Independence and Constitution so from the hotel you have to walk south on 13th street past Massachusetts, L, K, I, H, New York, G, Pennsylvania, F, and EThere are 8 floors to this hotel and we had no problems with the elevators. Our room number was 700 and for some unknown reason was behind double doors with room 701. A check of the other floors confirmed this was the case on each floor. If you want quiet then ask for a different room. There was a group of kids staying in room 701 and instead of using their room key, they put the safety bar out. All we could hear all night long were the kids running up and down the hall, their door banging against that safety bar and the door from the hallway to our hallway banging shut. The layout is difficult to explain so you just have to take my word for it. We also had three windows; two with a view of the brick walls of room 701 and one with the side of a building under construction and the alley. Although they say you can see the White House from some of the rooms I find this very hard to believe based on the size of the buildings surrounding the hotel. Also note that although the sign near the elevator states ""vending machine"" with an arrow on each floor, there is actually only an ice machine and they are located only on floors 4 and 6. The room was comfortable and clean but there was no closet and only an armoire to hang clothes. Of course you had to move the chair out of the way to get to the armoire. Our king bed room only had three pillows so I left a note for the maid to please leave an extra pillow and she did. On one day we came back to the room at 5:30 to find the maid cleaning our room which we thought was a little late in the day but that was ok since our door keys no longer worked and she let us into our room.  The hotel does not have refrigerators in the rooms so they must have remodeled since the 2004 visit by one reviewer. There is no pool either and the fitness room contains a treadmill and stair climber. Although they offer the use of a PC in the lobby, it never worked and despite a daily request for it to be checked, the desk clerks just shrugged their shoulders and ignored us. The General Manager finally took me into his office on the last day so I could check in for my return flight but by then it was too late and we could not access the flight information.Breakfast was outstanding and located on the basement level in a huge room with a TV. Some of the offerings were coffee, tea, orange, apple and cranberry juice, granola bars, boiled eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, toast, bagels, pastries, cereal and waffles. We had no problem finding something to eat. Our only problem was the unfriendly and uncooperative worker in the breakfast room. If you run both waffle irons and the toaster at the same time the circuits will blow. The worker walks around like a zombie and does not respond to your questions or concerns. She completely ignores you. Usually we ate breakfast around 7 a.m. but on the last day did not eat breakfast until after 8. By that time several people had used the waffle iron so the waffles were sticking. There was no spray so the waffles had to be picked out with a plastic knife. One of the other guests did not believe me when I told him the worker would not help him and foolishly asked the worker for spray. The worker told the guest that the waffle irons are sprayed once each morning then didn’t say another word. If you plan to eat waffles make sure you are an early riser. There are a few fast food restaurants about 4 blocks south of the hotel such as Quiznos, Dominos and McDonalds. Café Mozart, an excellent German restaurant and deli is located on H Street where it crosses New York. CVS pharmacy / drug store is on 14th near F Street. Overall the hotel was neat and clean and not bad for the price, considering the breakfast bar and the fact that I am a Choice Rewards member. The hotel is a little far from the monuments and museums. Although I am used to walking, by the second day we were unable to walk for more than a short distance so used the Metro the rest of our stay. The staff did nothing to make me feel as if they were happy I chose their hotel and all were quite rude. I would certainly recommend to my friends that they find a hotel a little closer to The Mall."

Another lower-cost hotel I’ve used downtown, was as musty and dark as it was historic. The Hive is bright and fresh. And oh so CLEAN! The staff were friendly and helpful. My tiny single room was thoughtfully designed. Plenty of space, actually. Could have used a slightly more comfortable (padded) chair, for the moments in the room when I wasn’t sleeping. I will be back!Hotel Hive is most definitely one of the most unique places where I have stayed. As a micro hotel, space is very cramped but very clean and nicely decorated. My room was big enough for a bunk bed, a tiny desk and nothing else. But the bedsheets were immaculate. The shower in the bathroom spotless. There was a flat screen TV for both the bottom and the top bunk. There was a radio on the desk, a phone on the wall and a desk lamp. Little shelves were drilled into the wall for the top and bottom bunk for the TV remotes which was useful. The outlets in the room even had ports for USB cables which I found very convenient. In the elevator shaft there's a graffiti mural depicting bees and honeycombs (they are Hotel ""Hive"" after all). The best thing about this hotel is the rooftop bar. Up there, there was couches and fire tables and plenty of seating. The view of Georgetown from up there was very nice. Unfortunately, there were not very many people since it was cold, but I imagine it would be packed in the summer. The only drawback for me is the noise level. At night, I could hear every siren, EVERY car horn and every laughing drunk person in the street. The first night I stayed I couldn't sleep hardly at all because of the noise and because the mattress felt a little too firm for me. I guess I'm not accustomed to sleeping in a bunk bed. I'm not sure if I would stay here again but if you're looking for a unique lodging experience Hotel Hive is definitely worth a try."

It was not the largest room but still had plenty of space. The staff was very helpful and friendly. This micro hotel is very cool with a nice entry entry, bar, roof top bar and adjoining pizza place(& Pizza). The location is great as it is close to the Mall/metro and restaurants. I would recommend staying here if coming to D.C.So my buddy booked this hotel for us, and I was wildly apprehensive. I'm a 40 year old and I was going to climb into a bunk bed. I was actually laughing as I checked in with Lionel, telling him about the preposterousness of the situation. Well, Lionel did his thing, and kind of put me at ease, asking me about my trip and my plans for the weekend. I mentioned it was my first time in DC, so he pulled out a map and the hive guide and gave me a rundown of what to check out.I checked into the room, and rode the super-cool elevator up to my floor (5th), through hallways that reminded me of a cruise ship. The room was thoroughly small. I'm certain it was under 100sq ft, plus the bathroom and a hallway. It was clean and well laid out though, so bonus.I went to the amazingly busy hive bar, pulled up a stool and had a few drinks while waiting for my evening plans to sort out, and had some great liquor, after which I left and headed out for the evening.I came back after dinner and drinks to find the lobby bar still jam packed. Had a night cap (the bartender remembered my drink from earlier) and hit the room to get ready for bed.The bed itself was really comfortable. I was a comfortable temperature all night, and found the room to be mostly quiet (a lot of sirens in DC). Woke up around 9 and headed out after a shower, which was a good size and quick to heat up.Arrived back, got ready for an event and headed back downstairs, and met Sakina. She was genuinely interested in knowing what was happening, and what we were up to (playing hockey at Capitol One Arena). She was great.After our event, we ran back to the hotel and dropped our stuff off and went back out again. The next day, I saw Sakina (probably) just coming in for her shift. She stopped and asked how everything was, what we did the night before, what we planned on doing that night, etc, really very friendly conversation. We went out for a bit, then came back for lunch at &pizza, and drinks at the bar. Sakina came over and chatted with us for 5 or 10 minutes, as it wasn't a busy time of day. Afterwards we sat at the fireplace and relaxed.We had one more dinner out, then came back to the hotel for a few more drinks and another pizza (5* restaurants don't really fill you up lol). All in all, I was hesitant about this place. I've stayed in 5* hotels across North America, and this place, although smaller, is the only one I really wanted to stay longer, and it's all down to the staff. Great job everyone! (Sorry, I only took photos of my drinks and food lol)Stayed here for three nights. I had selected the bunk bed room because it was an interesting concept. The rooms are very clean. They are a bit tight but if your out in the city exploring, you are really only using the room to sleep and shower. Internet connection speeds are fast. Hotel location is great for bus or subway transportation.What makes this hotel awesome is the staff. We were hosting a unique event in Washington and had some odd requests. The staff bent over backwards to help us accomplish this especially Sakina. She was wonderful is helping us out with directions and advice. She makes the Hotel Hive a pleasure."

We had just finished a 340mile bike ride and barmen offered us all a free bubbles to celebrate! The Hive rooms are modern and compact and, as my wife suffers a tad from claustrophobia, we asked was there bigger ones.

Although we didn’t stay at the hotel, we still decided to sit at the bar and enjoy some local adult beverages and while doing so, we met the awesome bartenders. Friendly and fun. LIZZY, JILL, DAVID, and LOUIS. We had great conversations with David and Lizzy about life, DC, Kentucky, & education. We had a blast and recommend this place to everyone who’s in the area.

I stumbled across Hotel Hive on my company’s hotel booking website as I was traveling for business and going to a Drake concert. I booked it not knowing much because I’m not from the DC area, but after looking at the website pictures I instantly fell in love.Upon arriving and walking in I loved the warm feeling and the beautiful chandelier. It was modern and buzzing with energy. I was immediately greeted by Lionel who literally made me feel like I had known him for years. His presence was sharp and his energy matched the upbeat vibe of the hotel.The elevator was a little small, but the theme is microhotel....think small and efficient. When walking into the room, I was taken aback as I did book a room with twin beds but did not read the website closely as these rooms do have bunk beds. In hindsight the bunk beds were kind of cool because they have their own flat screen TVs....but back to the story. I called guest services asking if I could switch rooms. Lionel was extremely polite and advised that this could be done the next day. Note, the room was still a great room. The next morning as I was leaving for work I walked up to the help desk and was warmly greeted by Ruthie. Ruthie was phenomenal! Not only was she personable, she was attentive, but she listened to why I was in town, how tiring my prior travel day was, the Drake concert I was in town for, and how I had mistakenly booked a bunk bed room. During our convo I was advised that the upgrade fee was $70. This was not something that I knew would be approved or not by my company, so I didn’t want to make a decision right then and there, but I went for it any way and asked for the up grade. She advised me that they would move my luggage to the room when I came back from the work day. When I came back in after work, I went to the front desk and explained that I had switched room the new front desk person had everything ready, no waiting. When I walked into the room, which was the king sized loft I was taken aback by how awesome the room was. It rustic and extremely spacious with a positive quotes on the wall. My bathroom mirror had the words “ you look perfect” on it. I loved that. I then looked on the desk and there was an envelope. I opened it to the sweetest handwritten message ( photo attached) saying that my upgrade and two rounds of drinks was on the house, and wishing me a fun concert. It honestly made my whole trip, and really made me feel special. It wasn’t about the upgrade or the drinks, but the fact that they truly went out of their way and made me feel like a rock star. To summarize: My stay was not awesome because of the great location or amazing cool room, but it was the people. I strongly recommend a staying at the hotel, so you can see just what I mean. To Hotel Hive- Thank you for a wonderful stay and making a hotel feel like home."

I recently headed over to Hotel Hive to check out this new micro hotel design and experience their customer service, as the property consistently gets amazing reviews. The design and service didn't disappoint. Check in was a breeze with David. He offered up suggestions and info in a friendly and helpful, laid-back manner. I had a buzz bunk room on the 3rd floor. It was a small room, but that is to be totally expected, again, it is a micro-hotel. It reminded me of my dorm room in college, just trendier. The rooftop bar was closed for weather-related issues, but the lobby bar was hopping with a mixed age happy hour crowd. &Pizza is located at the lobby level, however, I chose to head over to an Indian Streetfood restaurant around the corner (which was good). The location of Hotel Hive is fabulous. Close to GWU, restaurants, and local attractions. It is an affordable option with great style for those on a budget that want to be down near the action. While I was in the lobby, a couple different guests seemed confused by the micro-hotel idea, but David provided excellent service and was able to make each and every guest happy. They truly want all of their guests to enjoy their experience! Excellence in hospitality."

However...What blew me away about this place was the staff. My trip began with a lost bag and few other travel related issues. I was greeted at the hotel by Ruthie and Sakina - they made sure I had everything I needed and then some. During my stay I got lost taking the metro, so I called Dave at the front desk, and he helped me get back to the hotel - and Eliza was always happy to help me with any questions I had. The food and hotel bar were so great! Graham, Dylan, Ali and Sef always made sure I was properly fueled with coffee, beer, or delicious pizza during my stay. These people always had a smile on their face for me, and everyone clearly strived to do their part, however small to make not only mine, but every guest's experience a good one. Hotel Hive is doing something right to have a staff that cares so genuinely for what they do, the role they play in providing such excellent hospitality, and how that can impact the people who choose to stay there.

We walked to the show and back at night and didn't feel even slightly uncomfortable. With the hotel sandwiched between the theatre and GWU, it is in a great location. The price was without our reach, which helped. Every staff member we encountered went out of his/her way to be friendly and helpful. In particular, Liz went above and beyond to show us where to go.

My wife and I wanted a fun hotel for our 2 daughters (ages 7 + 9) to enjoy with easy access to the typical DC sightseeing scene. Hive Hotel was a homerun! From the ease of booking over the phone with Ruthie, to the enthusiasm of the hotel staff when you arrive...these people know how to make you feel welcome and they give you tons of information to make your visit enjoyable. Liz at the front desk was a wealth of knowledge and she seems like she genuinely loves her job and taking care of guests. The whole staff rocks but Liz and Ruthie were incredible. We had adjoining rooms and my daughters loved their bunk bed room while ours was a queen with an amazing 180 degree view of F street, Virginia Ave, and 23rd Street...a block from Watergate and across the street from George Washington University. Perfectly located just one mile from the White House and just over a mile from Georgetown. We spent two days seeing monuments, sightseeing all over DC, catching a Nationals game, eating at some great restaurants in Georgetown... but my wife and daughters said the highlight of the trip was Hotel Hive. We travel a lot and try to stay at boutique hotels, this was by far their favorite experience. Awesome hotel, great location, super fun staff, and it's a one-of-a-kind experience. We definitely will be back in the future. Hotel Hive is a no brainier!"

I could not have been more pleased when I walked in my room. It’s small but has everything a person needs. It had cute sayings on the wall and mirror, furnished nicely, and most importantly extremely clean. Quiet and close to the landmarks tourists are there to see. Excellent pizza restaurant and bar downstairs. Staff was friendly and attentive. I had a lovely conversation with one of the service agents, David Geyer, detailing unforgettable moments in my day and he actually seemed to care and share in my excitement! All I can say is that this place made a 60 year old woman feel 20 again! Highly recommend - would definitely stay againI love this hotel. I love it for the incredibly helpful and friendly staff (they go way beyond expectation, and way beyond what I have encountered elsewhere). I love it for its convenient location, so close to all of the things I wanted to see and do in DC. I love it for its unique elegance and quirky fun...it is a sight to behold. I love it for the great food and drink opportunities in house. I love it for the super soft towels and bed linens that made my stay here so much better. I love it for the bunk beds, with each bed having its own TV/remote. I love it for the wonderful shower equipped with shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash...what a treat! This hotel is perfect for me, and I will return any time I am in DC.This hotel is not for everyone. If you need a lot of ""bells and whistles"" this is not the place for you. It is a microtel with smaller rooms. The rooms are nicely equipped and space is used efficiently. However, if you need a gym, a business center, a microwave, a pool/hot tub, a fridge, etc...this is probably not for you. They will bring in fridges/microwaves, they will print things off for you at the front desk, and there is a nearby gym, but you might not want to bother.In my opinion, the things I love far outweigh the things you don't have at this hotel."

So I will start with the BUT. On Trip Advisor I was quoted a rate and a discount and free drink. I had trouble with my reservation and made a screen shot with my problem shown. The image shows the rate and the discount of which i received neither (I did get the drink). I was in a hurry when I checked out so did not review my bill. Not only did I not receive the rate I saw on Trip Adviser but was charged two different rates for each day one successively higher that the other. I ended up paying $85 dollars more than i had planned on. Now its probably in the fine print somewhere but this is the first time I have experienced this on Trip Advisor. I've always gotten the rate I saw when I booked the room. I called and talked to a rep at the hotel. I emailed her my screen shot showing the rate and the discount. No resolution at this point.Now for the positive, It is great for active people who just need a place to lay their head. The room is small, there is no closet (just a extendable rack to hang things), no dresser (roll-away under the bed). The bed was comfortable but in our room you both get in on one side. The hotel bar and roof top bar are fun, fast and friendly. I would use this hotel again but I would confirm my rate before had to be sure of what you are paying.Wow, what a wonderful vacation. The Hive Hotel is seriously an amazing little gem of a hotel. Every single employee was over the top happy and helpful. They made us feel like an old friend. Our room was perfect. Clean, spacious, comfortable. We will be seeing you again soon!❤️"

The staff was beyond friendly and helpful. The elevator is small and at times slow but so fun as the walls are glass and the cement walls are painted like the outdoors and a beehive. Our room 508, was the second smallest in the hotel. It was a loft bunk but not the loft bunk pictured on the website. It was beyond tight, but my 12 year old loved it and the bunk. I could have done with just a touch more room and a better mattress.( when I mentioned it to the front desk staff they apologized, said they would look into it right away and offered me a free pizza in the shop attached). Another thing to keep in mind. The funky a/c heat units. They don’t have a specific ax or heat mode. Just on and off and set the temp. It will cool to the temp you set. Then is you want to set the room at a slightly higher temp once you cool down, the heater switches on to heat it up immediately. Loved the soap shampoo conditioner and lotion dispensers. They are full size attached to the shower wall with pumps. You never run out. With my hair, I use almost a whole tiny bottle in one setting! Location was great. Right in the heart of George Washington University. Not too busy as school was out for summer. Just a few short blocks from the metro station. Lots of restaurants with in easy walking and also a Whole Foods. A long walk to the Lincoln Memorial end of the mal but doable. Near the Watergate hotel and dock for the riverboat rides. Near Georgetown too. The breakfast items were pastries and some odd breakfast pizzas but ok. The pizza for dinner was good and convenient. The hive bar in the lobby as nice and welcoming. Didn’t get to check out the roof top bar as it is over 21 all the time. Room note, the website metió s the basement rooms may be loud from the bar noise. They don’t mention. That the loft rooms get the music from the rooftop bar but it ended at 11 so no big deal. Over all a great stay for 6 nights in DC at a reasonable price for being so close to everything."

Rooms are tight, but were very clean and well maintained. Bath and shower were plenty roomy. We chose a queen hive on an upper floor and were happy with how quiet it was. Great location, down the strret from Foggy Bottom metro, providing easy access to transportation. Walking distance to Lincoln Memorial and mall.Hive rooftop bar was fun and provided great neighborhood views. Limited drink offerings, but adequate. Hive Bar is full service and staff is attentive. Pizza is quite good and reasonable..Hotel staff was extremely helpful and willing to provide any assistance needed. Ruthie Thomas was exceptional in making us welcome and happy! Special thanks to her, as it made our vacation stay in DC memorable! Hive Hotel is unique in its offerings, but we didnt need lots of space! We were very pleased!Excellent for a solo traveler, the room where I stayed was tiny and I loved, it was super clean.

Everyone was super friendly. Liz and Lionel kept our bags for us before check-in and after checkout before our flight. The rooftop bar had some great choices, and Ali at the bar referred us to some great local events. We had the Hive King room. It's not super spacious but it really makes up for it in comfort.

If however, you appreciate personal service, well appointed clean rooms, a stellar rooftop bar, and a beautiful hotel tucked into a vibrant neighborhood; within walking distance of a metro, Hotel Hive is your place. From the new entrance, with a great ramp to the unique elevator that transports you to upper rooms and the fun rooftop bar, I was more than happily surprised and thankful. I found myself in an accessible Queen room with a wonderful roll in shower with a built in seat. The bed was easy to transfer to from my wheelchair and easy to get around. The only addition I mentioned to them and the staff was incredibly receptive about was the possible addition of a rolling cart that could go from room to room as rolling storage. The view from room 201 was great and when I needed to get away, the automated blinds were a welcome addition. My first night it was a bit loud for about fifteen minutes but quieted after ten p.m. Besides the attentive staff, the favorite part of my stay was the rooftop bar. The view was fantastic and the crowd busy, but not overwhelming. The drinks are also not to be missed. For the coffee crowd they have great locally roasted coffee too! Well priced for the area and amenities, this will be my DC home base whenever I find myself in the area."

Rooms a little on the small side, but for the low prices it's difficult to complain, though it did mean we were slightly tripping over our luggage for the entire holiday.Hotel Hive is one of the best hotels I've ever experienced! My boyfriend and I decided to go to DC for the weekend and we were unsure where to stay, a friend suggested Hotel Hive and after staying there I can truly say when we come back for our next trip, we won't be staying anywhere else but Hotel Hive!! Very close to all of the monuments/memorials (the picture attached is of our hotel room window and the Monument a few blocks awayso you can see how close we are!) and we were so close to the White House we could see the helicopters when The president arrived home! This hotel definitely gives you the most bang for your buck! The rooms are a little smaller than a normal hotel (that's why it's called a micro hotel) but there's nothing micro about it! And when you think about it, you're only in your hotel room to sleep/shower so you don't need all that extra space! (That's also how the price stays so low!) When we first arrived the young lady at the desk was so wonderful her name was Ruthie and she told us everything about the hotel, then gave us a map and showed us where the best sites around the city were! She was so very sweet and made sure we were okay with parking and where our room was etc. Our room was on the third floor and it was beautiful and everything was so clean and crisp white but not sterile feeling at all! Once we were settled in we went to check out the rooftop bar and let me tell you this was our favorite part! We have a rooftop bar in our hometown but nothing like this! There's plenty of seating and the views are amazing!! The gentlemen at the bar were so nice and very quick with the drinks! The next morning we had breakfast in the entrance level cafe where Jill was our server and she was so sweet and down to earth she made sure we had a nice breakfast! Over in the lobby area was another girl at the front desk named Liz and she was working her butt off getting guests checked in and helping another guest with her bag she really went above and beyond for another customer and that was really wonderful to see! She had incredible control over the whole morning which from a guest point of view looked like so much to do! After breakfast she talked to us about how old the building is, where the best restaurants are, which route along dc we should take, how long it'll take to get to wherever we wanted to go etc. she's a wealth of information!! She took such great care of us with whatever we needed! Also a shoutout to Liz from another guest that I overheard talking about her, she was at the desk checking someone in and we were still in the cafe and the family behind us could not stop raving about her because the guest had some special requests like flowers she had shipped to her room and something special for an elderly guest that was with her, they said that Liz took such great care of them and set everything up the way they requested and that they would definitely come back because of the excellent service from Liz! The staff at this hotel is not just trying to do their jobs, they really care about how your stay is going and if you need anything all with the biggest smiles and greatest attitude possible! The atmosphere of the employees feels so much like a family (which is sometimes really hard to establish in a work environment!) if I lived in the area I'd want to work there! Our stay at Hotel Hive was absolutely perfect I have not one negative thing to say about the whole place!! Thank you to the staff your hard work shows!!"

The staff was very friendly and accommodating, excellent communication on the amenities available. The rooms are small but very clean and have everything you need (if you need anything they bring it right too you). The beds are very comfortable, we stayed in room 313 which was right up the steps from the lobby which was convenient. Cute bar adjacent to the lobby, beautiful rooftop deck and nice patio out front. Adorable decor too! Didn't get to try the pizza, hope to next time. Again, really can't say enough about the staff and thier customer service skills..the bigger chains should check out how they are training thier people because they were really too notch and seem genuine in wanting thier guests to have a great stay! Will definitely be back!"

We shared a queen room. The room was very clean, bed comfortable, sheets nice, hip atmosphere, all great. The location was fantastic (5 minutes walk to Lincoln Memorial, 10 minutes to the White House, 15 minutes to Georgetown) and the only hotel in the area that was in this price range. The only “bad” thing is that the rooms are really small. It was annoying for us, but not a huge problem, but I could see it being problematic for larger people. The staff went out of their way to be nice, maybe even too much. The pizza restaurant was yummy. Be sure to bring ear plugs if you stay in a “stairwell “ room, because sound travels. I would stay here again."

Originally booked a hive king, but we're upgraded to the top floor. We stayed in a queen loft room and we had a great view of the places around us. Bathroom was clean and updated, it came equipped with shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The shower was also very roomy and contained a seat. Everyone we came in contact with was great. We were in 15 minute walking distance of all the monuments and the white house. The bar in the hotel was very charming and had a great drink menu. If I ever find myself in D.C again, I will definitely come back. The minimalistic design of the hotel was very cute and I enjoyed staying here. Be mindful that this is a ""microtel"", which means the rooms are much more compact. I can say that they are very comfortable and my boyfriend and I had just enough room for the two of us.We drove in from Chicago to join The March For Our Lives. It was the perfect home base. A quick walk to the Lincoln Memorial. Around the corner from Founding Farmers. And the bar at Hive is the perfect place to end the night before stumbling to the elevator. The elevator, by the way, is the best art installation in town. One last thing you should know, if you have problems, any problems, ask Liz. She's a fixer!"

I didn't even read the reviews! But it is a great little mini hotel.The experience starts from when you check in at a busy lobby between a takeaway pizza kitchen and a small cafe/pizzeria. The place looks like an old loft building with hand painted signs and a kooky air about it. I had a regular double room on the 4th floor, and as the lift goes up, the glass walls of the lift go past changing art on the wall. The corridors are tiny, the room is compact but they've done a great job of using the space well by leaving an area under the bed for the suitcases and a wheely tray that can be used like cabinet shelves. For any clothes you want to hang, there's a discreet metal bar that can be pulled out and the accompanying hangers can be used to hang stuff you don't want to put away under the bed. There's a room safe that was large enough to hold my big makeup case and even my 13"" laptop with plenty of space still remaining. The bathroom is also compact but clean and well laid out with plenty of supplies, and a proper bathroom cabinet behind the well lit mirror.The fun stuff is that the mirror and walls in the room have a quote and a joke and a small potted plant sits on the windowsill. All of these things just make this feel like a high class university halls of residence room. In a good way.The hotel is a 5min walk from Foggy Bottom metro, a 12min walk from Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall and about a 20min walk from Georgetown shops.Last but not the least, the receptionists are amazing. All helpful, all willing to chat you through sightseeing options, but RUTHIE especially stands out because no question was a bother for her and she really took the time to understand what I wanted to do and see and gave me awesome advice, in effect saving me a bunch of money on a hop on hop off bus. This is not a traditional ""hotel""... But it manages the vibe between a hostel and hotel really well. If I ever return to Washington DC, I'm going straight back to Hive."

It's a decent and doable walk into the main memorial and museum strip of Washington. There is an amazing pizza place attached which we frequented a lot. There is also a Whole Foods store 3 blocks away for easy fresh food. The hotel is new, clean and minimalistic in room decor which is all quite pleasant. However ... under NO circumstances accept a below ground room. Oh my goodness!!!! The noise from the bar above which is at the front entrance, is beyond a joke. Starting very early in the morning (before 7am) the furniture begins to be moved around and the foot stomping begins (from staff???). And it continues and increases well into the night as more and more people drag furniture from one end of the bar to the other and stomp loudly above your head. Now I know we were told it can be noisy but this was really beyond a joke. Quite unbelievable! Then ... the bed!! It feels like a mattress filled with concrete. Seriously no sleep happened in this hotel. Possibly other rooms are better and we we were told this was one of the larger rooms. So heaven help the size of those ones. But we can look past the size as we knew it was a micro room hotel. That being so, better design choices would be great to improve the room efficiency eg some shelving so you have somewhere to unpack (no one wants to drag out the ikea box from under the bed to get to your things) And the full length mirror is behind the only hanging space!!!! These 2 problems could easily be fixed.I'm not a TripAdvisor frequent whinger (read my many other reviews) but potential guests be aware!"

Some hotels seem stuffy and almost clinical, but this hotel is alive and fun. Arriving at 10pm, the staff were perky and pleasant. They made us feel welcome and while we were parking at the garage across the street, placed a hand-written welcome note in our room (we were celebrating an anniversary). The bar has seating for individuals, couples, small and medium-sized groups. Only one TV means this is no sports bar, it is a cool place to hang and chill. The rooms have simple, interesting sayings as wall art and our mirror stated, ""You're Perfect!"" The room was sparkling clean including the bathroom/shower. The towels were amazingly soft!On the down-side… (pun intended) I am a side-sleeper and found my bed to be too hard. The bed in our Buzz King room was basically a down mattress over a hard frame, no box spring. The pillows were unusual to me in that the fill could move around, like squeezing a balloon displaces air. For my experience, this created not enough support under my head. Overall, the stay was a pleasant experience, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The only reason we wouldn’t return to this hotel is the bed and pillows. Everything else was great."

When we travel we normally book Marriott or Hyatt type hotels. After seeing good reviews and knowing our stay was relatively short we decided to give it a try. Here are some pros and cons;Pros-- Probably the cheapest hotel that is actually in the DC area.- Hotel was clean, room was very clean. - Bathroom and Shower was clean- Although the room was small it had a lot of character, our particular room was a Queen Loft, RM #518. -Hotel has a pizza restaurant on site for those who seek an easy meal.Cons- - While the hotel is not located in a bad area of town it is certainly not upscale. There was a homeless mans camp on the edge of the street that we had to walk past each time we walked to the parking garage. While it's not the hotels fault it did make my wife a bit nervous to walk past the man talking to himself. - The hotel website is clear that there is no on site parking offered by the hotel however the parking situation was not convenient, you can either choose metered street parking which was often hard/impossible to find or park in a nearby parking garage. The parking garage is not adjacent to the hotel and the walk was approximately 3-5min from the parking garage to the hotel. - If you choose not to do metered street parking the parking garage is $21.00 per night and this is not included in your nightly rate. I felt the parking fee was high based on how inconvenient the location of the parking garage was. - While I did not notice this, my wife felt the street noise was loud during the night, No we are not in our 80's, we are in our 30's. The hotel itself is just fine and other than the parking issue I think most folks would be very happy with this hotel. For me the"

Every inch of this hotel is an experience. The modern sleek design of this hotel makes it very attractive and enjoyable to be in. If that isn't enough, the service here is absolutely mind-blowing!First, Liz at the front desk was nothing short of spectacular! No only was her temperament second to none, but her approachable attitude made the visit enjoyable from the second we walked through the door. I was able to not only witness her interacting with the guests like ourselves, but also heard her talking on the phone as well. Whether the situation was positive or negative, Liz was professional in every sense of the word. She made our first experience at this location nothing short of perfect! I will definitely be back without a doubt!Second, I did not get the pleasure of meeting Jaqui during my visit unfortunately. However, I would like to extend a huge thank you for allowing this event to take place in her establishment. The service from all parties involved was impeccable. I have stayed in many hotels varying in star rating however, Hotel Hive exceeded all of my previous experiences. Jaqui runs an amazing establishment here and even though I was unable to meet her in person I can tell from my experience she's amazing!Lastly, Terran behind the bar was excellent! He made sure all of our needs were taken care of in a genuine manner. Not only were his drinks delicious, but his service behind and around the bar was flawless. He made sure that when we resided in his area of the hotel we felt like true patrons and not just people staying at this establishment. Even if I wasn't staying here for a night, I would surely stop in for a drink and a pizza from &Pizza (which is connected to this hotel as well).I called this morning to confirm some of this information (i.e. names) and spoke with Ruthie. She was very pleasant and helpful in providing me with the information needed to complete this review!"

My overall experience was phenomenal. The amount of positive energy extended by the staff and front desk members echoed throughout my stay. I was in town for a medical conference and booked this hotel out of curiosity. Best decision I made, this hotel offers the perfect balance between cost effectiveness, location, and comfort. Hotel Hive offers everything you need for a great stay. The location is superb, extremely close to all the attractions which you can see from the rooftop bar. The bar and restaurant areas offer comfortable, relaxing and casual atmospheres. Perfect for grabbing drinks with friends and family. Also there is a 'build your own pizza' shop located in the hotel. Very tasty! I ate there both days. Attached below are my pictures.I stayed in the Hive King Room. First impressions: very clean, tidy and modern. The the room was comfortable, had a nice table to get work done. The room comes equipped with a safe which I thought was a great addition to keep valuables secure. The bathroom was very up-to-date and modern as well. Best feature of the king room is by far the view and aesthetics. The ambience was very pleasant on the eyes and felt like I was staying in an upscale loft. Overall, I highly recommend Hotel Hive for anyone looking to stay in the Washington D.C. area. Hotel Hive has done an amazing job catering to all people whether you are in town for business or pleasure. The attention to detail from the brick walls, art, paint, rooms, decor, and facilities are top-notch. Additionally, the staff without a doubt goes above and beyond to provide the best comfort. Will definitely be staying here the next time I'm in town. Thank you for Everything!Best,Dr. Alexander"

I could not asked for a better hotel experience. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Jackie and the rest of the wonderful front desk staff. They gave us all the info that we needed know as this was our first visit to the Hotel Hive. During our ride up the elevator - the kids were mesmerized by the art found on the elevator shaft’s walls. Upon entering our rooms, our kids were excited to find that the front desk staff had placed hand written “welcome” notes on our beds. It was a wonderful surprise not only for us but for our two teenage girls who were experiencing their first “solo” stay in their own rooms. It made us feel like we were staying with family. While we were here, we did also took in a little late night pizza break from &pizza. My kids gave the pizza two thumbs up. Overall, we could not been happier with our stay and can not wait to visit again."

My room was 110, directly under the pizza shop and it was soooo loud! It was like an elephant pounding on the ceiling. Along with that, I could hear the loud music. I asked the front desk when it would stop and they said it closed @ 11. Well it started up again early the next morning.... pounding and loud banging. Totally ruined my sleep ☹️The service at Hotel Hive is outstanding! We arrived around 9 a.m after a red-eye flight from San Diego to Baltimore and driving a rental in. If visiting DC for a very short time, I highly recommend flying into Regan International (DCA), Baltimore (BWI) is too far! I tried getting an early check in but it wasn't happening. Totally understandable... The front desk is kind to hold our luggage and offer nearby attractions. The coffee at the bar is pretty good too. Decided to have breakfast a few blocks away, pick up provisions at a nearby Whole Foods, then hit the sights - National Mall.When we were able to get into our room at 3 p.m. sharp it was heaven. We received a free upgrade (it was hubby's birthday) and a couple of free adult beverages from either bar (lobby or rooftop). The bed, pillows and towels are plush but room size quaint. The view of Foggy Bottom neighborhood was pretty cool with George Washington University directly across the street and the main road around the corner, it was pretty quiet considering it being a busy area.Overall I'd stay at Hotel Hive again because of it being centrally located to the National Mall, a few blocks from the metro line and close proximity to really good places to eat. I highly recommend &pizza in the hotel lobby."

LOVE this place. We stayed in two different rooms because we left for a day during our trip and both rooms were fantastic. Rooms are small but they have utilized every square inch of space and have so many thoughtful touches. The website photos are a great representation of the rooms which helped in choosing which one to book. From the minute you walk in the door every person you meet is focused on making your stay a success. We arrived early and they stored our luggage until we were ready for our room then brought it up to the room for us which we totally did not expect. The location is also perfect. We walked all over town and did lots of sightseeing. The pizza at &pizza was delicious and even had gluten free options for me. Yum. Because the hotel is located right by George Washington University there are many affordable places to eat nearby and a metro station right by. Can’t go wrong here - thanks to everyone at the Hive for making our anniversary wonderful.

Four blocks west of the White House in Foggy Bottom. A mile walk to beautiful Georgetown. Lincoln Memorial a stones throw. Rooms are small but comfortable. We got a loft bunk and we were thrilled. Each bunk gets its own TV!!! First time my husband and I didn't fight over a remote. Bathroom quite spacious, shower had great pressure and kept the temperature even in the morning, and the toilet seats don't slam. But best yet might be the pizza. $10 a pie easily feeds two people but you could probably finish your own if really hungry. We're vegetarians and there were only two pizzas we didn't try because too much to substitute. Our favorite is Moonstruck followed by the Salad pizza. If you don't stay, at least come for the pizza and a drink -- all the liquor, beer and wine is local and the beers change daily. I will definitely be back to this hotel.This was our first time staying in DC and we had nothing to go off of other than reviews and online pictures when booking a hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel was so much nicer in person than even the pictures showed. I called a day ahead for early arrival accommodations and to my surprise they remembered the exact conversation as soon as I said I was there to check in early. They quickly accommodated us and had a room available. I do not remember anyone's name, but everyone we came in contact was super friendly! We were made to feel welcome immediately. We booked a Buzz room and it was just big enough for a short quick stay for 2 of us. We were given and option of upstairs or downstairs and opted for downstairs since this was what was immediately available. Unfortunately we didn't realize that there was noise downstairs from the bar/restaurant upstairs until closing, but once I requested to move and different accommodations due to the noise the front desk quickly resolved the problem with no arguments! I was very satisfied with how attentive to their guests they were! The entire hotel was super clean and has a very cool design which made it unique and not your standard hotel which I look for when traveling. If you don't want to stay in a standard hotel and want something unique this is the place. The location was perfect and easy to access anything you wanted to do (restaurants, sightseeing, etc). It is in a college area so as long as you don't mind college kids this is the perfect location. We walked to just about everywhere and Ubered to the locations we didn't want to walk to. The pizza place attached to the hotel, &pizza, was delicious! Must try during your stay. Prices are reasonable. One other detail that I thought was great for a quick trip is they have full size shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash already in the shower attached to the wall so if you are wanting to only bring carryon then no worries on filling space with these items! If I ever come back to DC this is where I will be! Thanks for a great trip!"

Just a short walk to the Lincoln Memorial and to the Metro Station. The hotel is very clean and modern. The shower had 3 settings which I was great. The room we stayed in had bunkbeds, both of which had a TV at the end of each bed. However, when you switch one on they both turned on. When one tried to change channel it changed both TV's channels. The room was also very claustrophobic I wouldn't have wanted to have stayed in that room for another night. There was no room to move or spread out."

It seems like the bar and restaurant are popular not only with hotel guests, but also with DC locals and students at GW university.I stayed in one of the rooms with bunk beds. The room was clean, and the bunk beds were comfortable. I like it that the guest rooms have windows that you can crack open a couple of inches. It also felt like the room had very good sound proofing/insulation as I did not hear any noise coming from other guest rooms nor any street noise from cars or sirens. If you are staying on a Sunday,then keep in mind that street parking is FREE in DC on Sundays. There was plenty of free street parking during my Sunday evening stay.I can 100% recommend the Hotel Hive and I am looking forward to staying there again.!This hotel is well-located in the middle of Foggy Bottom and George Washington University campus. It's a 5 minute walk to the Mall, the Metro and 20 minute walk to Georgetown one way or the White House the other. This is a distinctly different hotel with a younger clientele and a very positive ""buzz."". The Hive is an oddly shaped building from early 1900's that's been immaculately and very trendily decorated. It's has a fantastic roof bar but many guests including us griped the roof bar is only open 4:30pm to 11:00---such a waste as how nice would breakfast or lunch be up there, especially on the weekends? And the music is just a little unnecessarily loud. My other point to note is that there is a vast difference in room size!! So try to scope it out--I had room 519, a very nice-sized king room. My sister however had room 508 for $30 less and it was soooo tiny!! Finally: please fix the water pressure. We like very much your towel and linen ""green"" policy, but such low water pressure just keeps us longer in the shower -- and we're all time-poor!!"

The hotels website was very open and clear about the room types and sizes, and I booked the loft room so I didn't get the basement rooms with no view or the ones immediately adjacent to the bar.My room was absolutely tiny, but it was fine. The room was spotlessly clean, the bed was comfy and the shower was good.The hotel has very friendly and welcoming staff on reception and in the bar. The onsite pizzas are very tasty too.I do like a hotel that's a little kooky, and Hive certainly is. I was pleased with what I got for the price I paid given the rates were lower than most other central Washington hotels. The location was fab too, just a short walk to the mall and the Lincoln memorial.Recommended."

I was in Washington DC for 8 days. Earlier in the week, I stayed at two other, much larger, name-brand hotels for a work conference. I much preferred Hotel Hive. Pardon me while I say ""love"" many times! I love that it is a smaller hotel; the personal service I received made my trip. Upon check-in, the staff provided a great map of DC and pointed out places of interest and how to get there. They remembered my name when I came down to the lobby in the morning. After I had been in my room for about 15 minutes after check in, the front desk called to see how I was settling in and asked if I needed anything. Wow! Another great aspect of the hotel is the location. It is right in the middle of the campus of The George Washington University. A lot of fun and funky restaurants and cafes all around. The subway entrance is three blocks away and the best part, it's about a 10 minute walk to the Lincoln Memorial and the other memorials that are in that same area. The rooms might be small, but they are actually the right fit; no wasted space. Because really, are you going to be leading a yoga class in your hotel room? Full bathroom, desk and chair and clock radio. The walk-in shower was huge! Big fluffy white towels too! You can control the exact temperature in your room. So much better than the usual on/off and low/high! I had the room with bunk beds. Each bed had a flat-screen TV at the foot of the bed which I thought was very neat. The bed was comfortable and had very soft sheets. I love the industrial loft-look of the hotel. The lobby was in the middle, swandwiched between their pizza place (&Pizza) and cocktail bar. You can get the pizza to take out, eat in your room, eat on the outdoor patios or even be served in the bar. My first night I had the pizza in the bar and it was fantastic. There is a rooftop terrace/bar with very nice views of the surrounding area. The seating area is mostly covered; I was able to sit up there comfortably all evening during a rainstorm. They make some pretty tasty frozen cocktails on the roof too!Seriously, I've been telling everyone since I got back home about Hotel Hive. My boss asked me how the conference was; I said, ""forget about the conference; let me tell you about Hotel Hive!""Great hotel in a great location! The staff was amazingly friendly, good flatbread pizzas, and a bartender that treated you were like a local not a tourist, thank you Kristina!! The charm of the place is great, lots of character. The room is going to be small, but clean with everything you need! Rooftop bar and bar downstairs give you a place to relax and have a drink! Good spot for singles or couples, price cannot be beat!"

The atmosphere is fun at this hotel, the rooms are small but very well thought out and just what you need for resting up for another day. They are comfortable and first and foremost on my list very clean. The staff is what really stands out, they were friendly and very helpful. Every day they asked where we were going and offered to help in any way they could. At night they remembered our destinations and asked how the day had been. It was like coming home to family. One of the intern concierges, Dave, was absolutely fantastic. He even stayed late one night to make sure two of his families (ours included) made it back safely from the soccer game at Fed Ex field.

The hostess upon check-in gave us 3 coupon for complimentary drinks and pizza for my birthday. The pizza is a must have! Great rooftop bar at the top.

This hotel is in a perfect location close to Froggy station, bus stops and most popular attractions in D.C.

After a little research online, I stumbled upon Hotel Hive, Washington D.C.'s first microhotel. Housed in a 116 year-old building, the hotel was designed with a focus on sustainability and with a playful, modern aesthetic. Oh, and did I mention it's rooftop bar serves frosé? The staff could have not been more friendly and accommodating, and the rooms, while small, were clean and very comfortable. We also enjoyed pizza from &pizza with friends both nights of our stay, and were very pleased with the product."

It says three star, of course, the standard was good the only thing which surprises me is the size of the room to tiny.walking around the room was a little difficult for me.The staffs at the reception were extraordinary. Breakfast was no choice at all.The staff was very friendly and took the time to learn things about us to make sure we had a good time. The rooms aren't as big as other hotels, but we couldn't beat the price, and they pack in a lot of conveniences (under-bed storage, USB outlets, automated window shades, liquid soaps instead of those annoying and wasteful bars). Our room and the hotel in general were decorated in a cool modern, urban style. The location was perfect for us since it put us in easy walking distance of the Kennedy Center where we saw a show and Georgetown where we had dinner. The beds were stiffer than my husband and I prefer, but that's more a matter of taste. This hotel isn't for everyone, but if you want a good deal and a cool vibe, give it a chance."

I will begin that I am extremely meticulous and very picky when it comes to cleanliness. Everything at the Hive was perfection. The staff so very friendly and professional. From the lovely rooms (we had a queen loft) to the great pizza, we could not ask for more. I cannot even think of anywhere that they could improve! That is how wonderful this property is. The pizza place is great, along with the rooftop bar. The bathrooms were well stocked with Hive bath products so next time, I will not even have to worry about packing related items since their products were what I perceived as higher end. Location was good for travel to the Capitol, Rayburn Building and the White House. Will definitely return to this wonderful property!Perfect for solo travelers. Very safe area. Literally walk to the Lincoln Memorial and other attractions. Tour bus boarding about a 7 minute walk.

If you want to use your hotel room for sleeping and showering and keeping your stuff, then it is perfect. Also, all of the hotel staff is friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant that serves create your own pizza and two bars. It is all very minimalist. If you want 10,000 options on the menu, Then this is not the place for you. But if you can find something you like in most places then you should be fine. It's a good value and it's in a great neighborhood. I really enjoyed it."

The front desk staff are friendly and accommodating. The new rooftop bar is lovely, with a mix of sunshine and shade. Fair warning, they only serve a small selection of drinks, it is not a full bar. But beautiful views while you're up there.The queen loft room was very spacious for a micro hotel. The high ceiling with exposed beams was beautiful. The room made smart use of small space. The windows in the room open, so rare for a hotel! Everything was very clean. The bluetooth bedside radio was a nice touch, great sound. My only complaints about the room are related to sleeping. The bed was not very comfortable at all, it felt like a step above sleeping on the floor. And my room was right next to a door that slammed shut every time someone opened it, which did wake me up a few times as I slept. But even with those difficulties, I would still come back here and stay again! This hotel is a fantastic location, easy walking distance to many attractions. The staff were great, and the hotel is just so adorable. And at this price point, it can't be beat."

Could actually hear individual loud conversations. Through walls and vents. Unbelievable! Coffee in lobby $2.50 a cup. Hotel was clean, friendly but wat too loud.

Back in feb. for myself and my husband. Hotel hive popped up with some of the lowest rates. Skeptical at first seeing as hotel was new. Was glad to see all the good reviews popping up, and was excited to get there! I was prepared for the ""micro hotel"" small room. And to my surprise it was very comfortable for the two of us. With lots of storage under bed, shelf and a few drawers. We had a below queen room. Was nervous being partially underground, but room had 3 frosted glass windows that let in plenty of sunshine, with blinds to pull if desired. Bed was comfy, was quiet at night and early am, slept til at least 10 each day. Occasional ambulance sirens at night, but your near a hospital so what do you expect? Provided lotion and body wash were awesome, I always use my own shampoo/conditioner so didn't try those. Place was clean, and decor/design was beautiful. Every staff member was helpful, friendly and appeared to genuinely care that things were well and you were satisfied. The pizza and drinks were perfect, and as mentioned the bar gets crowded in the evenings. Location was perfect! Used the parking garage thru parking panda. And was pretty easy to navigate to and definitely an easy walk to hotel. Foggy bottom metro stop was a short stroll away. And metro is pretty easy to use. Good idea to look at the metro system and become a little familiar with it ahead of time. We used metro for sightseeing all over the city! Would definitely recommend anyone to this new gem!Start to finish the Hotel Hive was spot on! We were greeted by a beautiful lobby and welcoming staff. Around every corner you could see the attention to detail. From the ride up in the elevator (through glass panel walls you can see art work by local artists at each floor - which you must see to fully appreciate), to the stairwells, hallways and the rooms. The live plants throughout provided a homey welcoming feel. We came to visit for Valentines Day and upon entering the room I was greeted by a beautiful bouquet of 2 dozen perfect red roses with a card from my husband. He was able to arrange this with staff prior to our visit. I would describe the room as simple elegance. It was clean and very comfortable. Hotel Hive has an awesome bar area to enjoy a delicious coffee, cocktail or local beer as well as an adjoining pizza shop (&Pizza) with a great selection of pizzas (we tried many and loved them all). We are looking forward to a return visit to experience the newly opened rooftop bar. The staff was friendly, helpful and very attentive. Finally, I must say...location, location, location. We were able to walk to restaurants, shopping, local attractions and Georgetown. There was never a need to call for a ride once we arrived at the hotel. Without a doubt if your visiting DC, Hotel Hive in the place to stay! Or if living in DC, a perfect place for happy hour, dinner or an after dinner nightcap!The Hotel Hive is an ideal location to visit the sights of DC. It's within walking distance to the impressive memorials and monuments, and handy to Metro buses to take you downtown. My studio style room (Below Queen) was neat, clean and comfortable for a good night's sleep.The Hive Bar is busy every evening with local workers and hotel guests enjoying a selection of local beers and wines. Christina and the bar crew are all friendly and welcoming, keeping the bar ticking over and buzzing! Add a delicious gourmet pizza for dinner, and your evening will be very relaxing after a busy day of work or sightseeing.Next time I visit DC, I'll be back at the Hive. Cheers!"

From the second you walk in the door you are greeted by the attentive staff and gorgeous design work inside your stay at the bee hive. I travel for a living and have lived out of hotels for the last year which makes my standard of service, cleanliness, and overall experience, quite high. After 4 full nights here I can honestly say that I have not found anything that comes even close to what the owners and staff of this establishment have to offer. Everywhere you turn you see subtleties in design that tastefully express the one of a kind ""bee hive concept."" I had no idea what to expect when I read about the theme of Hotel Hive. I was worried it would feel a bit adolescent. I would say this is a great place for those (like myself) who enjoy quality and creativity.  Another aspect I could not get enough of was the fact that everything and I mean EVERYTHING was locally sourced. I sat down with the owner and he expressed that he is passionate about supporting their local suppliers; from all the alcohol being D.C. brewed and distilled to the coffee and tea that are locally distributed I found that even with their cocktails and food they have maintained the theme of truly being a ""hive"" community. And trust me when I say, these cocktails are seriously something else. Each and every one with their own unique taste but also they never once felt heavy on my stomach.  The rooms may be smaller than you may expect at first glance but you'll quickly come to realize that each room is designed to use its space the absolute most efficiency. Overall I would say that my time spent at the hive was a trip I will not soon forget. I found myself telling all of my friends and family that frequent D.C. that I have found their new spot! Because who doesn't want to ""Spend Less and Buzz More?!"" So much gratitude for the team, treatment, and lovely stay. I'll see you all soon enough!Above my expectations. This is a micro hotel but everything is new and bright and feels very spacious. You gotta have the pizza here when you stay and their hand soap smells so good. I'm gonna try and buy some off them ;)."

Stay at Hotel Hive,"Had a wonderful stay at Hotel Hive with my family. My kids (12 years old and 5 years old) enjoyed staying in their own room (bunk room) and my husband and I were in the queen room. It’s a great place to stay for a weekend getaway and play tourist in Washington, DC. The location is great. It’s ½ mile to Lincoln Memorial and a mile to Georgetown where we spend most of our days. We love the amenities in the room and the size for our family was perfect. The décor is fabulous and ambiance is inviting. . I highly recommend The Hotel Hive for family.I had a great experience at Hotel Hive over the weekend. The hotel is trendy, stylish and has a minimalist urban vibe. The room size was just right - no wasted space or money. The bed was heavenly and the room was super clean. Very welcoming, friendly and responsive staff. The location is fantastic. I was able to walk to the Lincoln Memorial to get the beautiful evening view of the memorial and the Mall. The White House is just down the street - and you'll walk through the George Washington University grounds to get there. And it's so close to the GW-Foggy Bottom Metro - you literally have access to everything D.C. offers. If you don't plan to be in your room or at the hotel all day, Hotel Hive offers great value and the best location. If you wanna hangout at the hotel, you've got all you need at Hotel Hive - comfortable rooms, great food (&pizza's oblong pizzas) and a full bar. I'm a fan and will definitely stay at Hotel Hive the next time I'm in town. P.S. Must try the candied jalapeno magarita at Hive Bar. Enjoy."

This was a great choice. The hotel is insanely clean and well-kept, the staff was very friendly, the rates are fantastic and the decor is beautiful. The bed was a stand-out, it was so comfortable we slept right through our late-night plans.My husband was a bit surprised by the small size of the room but that's because the term ""micro-hotel"" went in one ear and out the other. If you understand what you're booking; a small, green, room that's big on style and efficiency then you'll be just fine. If you're staying for multiple nights or with someone I can see it being cramped after awhile HOWEVER we had a standard hive queen room and I believe they have larger loft spaces if you need that.We had lunch reservations near Chinatown one day and tickets to a show at the Kennedy Center the next and this hotel made everywhere we needed to be easily accessible. The website suggests a lot for parking which we used but only moved the car once. The parking lot is an easy walking distance from the hotel (even with bags) and the Kennedy Center is a quick 10min walk from the lot and believe there's a metro stop nearby as well.If I had any suggestions for this hotel it would be to maybe put some corner pads on the bed-frame - husband bumped his shin a couple of times moving about. Also the toiletries are a bit too heavenly scented and the fragrance is very masculine. The shower head was a bit high as well, I'm 5'5 and had to stand on my toes to adjust it. Very minor concerns compared to how wonderful this property is. We'll be back soon probably with our kids in tow this time."

It was within a few minutes walk. The rooms were small, but perfect for what we needed - comfortable bed, clean, and nice staff. Parking isn't available at the hotel, but they offer a discount on one of the parking garages within walking distance. Parking is a premium in DC so it wasn't unusual or overpriced. The hotel was a good rate for service and location. We will definitely stay here again for all future visits to the Arena."

I am eager to return. Thank you Pod DC what an absolutely incredible experience. Special Kudos to Tomas, his professionalism and kindness were alone worth the price of admission. Thanks a million!Definitively the most accessible and convenient hotel in DC. I brought my son and his friend along for his birthday, they were thrilled with their bunk beds and double tvs more than his gifts! Fun fact - the $50 deposit held at check-in was returned to my credit card within 5 minutes of checking out. That was an absolute 1st!Stayed here Tuesday til Friday for my wife’s 50th birthday. Staff are so friendly and welcoming, always checking that everything was ok or if you needed anything. A plate of donuts was brought to the room 10 mins after we’d checked in, a really thoughtful touch. The hotel room is small but more than adequate for a couple. Clean, tidy, shower gel, hairdryer etc provided. A Safe was there to lock away any precious items. We didn’t eat or drink at Pod (plenty of places nearby) but food always smelt yummy as we passed through. Lots to do and see in Washington clearly, it’s exactly why we went. Staff recommended Georgetown so we went to this area too, great shops and nice harbour area. Thanks Pod, highly recommendable"

I saved a lot of money staying here. The room had everything I needed. Ice can be had at the Crimson diner which shares lobby space with hotel. Staff is very friendly. Area is busy with lots of restaurant choices. It’s a 2 1/2 block walk to conference center. Train nearby many buses. Bed was comfortable room is clean. Pack light if 2 are sharing a room. There is one rod with 8 hangers, 6 hooks a few shelf’s and a draw. There is a safe in the room. Front desk is very responsive. This is a good find if you can forgo the perks of a bigger hotel."

The staff was friendly and courteous. While the rooms are considered minimalist, they are very clean with a modern design. My boyfriend and I stayed in a room with a full bed and we still had more than enough space for us and our luggage. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom more than sufficient. There is a metro station across the street, and it's also very easy to head down 7th St to the National Mall. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and will be sure to book our stay there on our next DC trip!"

The hotel is located directly across the street from the Gallery Place/Chinatown metro stop - a really easy train ride (Yellow Line) from the Reagan National Airport (DCA). Check in was a breeze. Front desk staff are friendly and efficient. First floor of the hotel has a cafe and is attached to a whisky bar with rooftop bar (open in the evening).The room was very pod like - clean and efficient - the room has a queen sized bed with about a foot on all sides. large screen tv and sliding barn door to the bathroom with shower/toilet and sink. Very small closet space to stow a mid size bag, one drawer, a safe and space to hang a few jackets. I was on the 3rd floor facing H street - the windows are pretty solid and blocked most of the street noise - there's a white sound generator at the bedside that came in handy. If you're sensitive to noise - I'd recommend getting a room northward facing towards I street or one of the internal facing rooms. Black out curtains were great. Daily housekeeping was solid - linens were clean and well maintained.Locations is convenient to the Verizon Center (Capital One? I can't keep track) - plenty of restaurants within a few block walking distance. Movie theater across the street. Yard House up the block etc.  Overall - great location, clean and comfortable and efficient. Great for a solo traveler or couple that can tolerate close quarters. . .Stayed here with my Fiance last week and I have to say the next time we are in DC we will stay here again. I dont think there is any need to stay anywhere else! The price of the hotel was great compared to other hotels in that area. The hotel is stylish and trendy without loosing that warm hospitality. Staff is friendly and the restaurants are fantastic. I wish the rooftop bar had a few more food offerings but I understand the model and I am not complaining about it. The Vanilla latte I ordered from the coffee shop was AMAZING!I look forward to my return to D.C and to Pod DC Hotel!"

And we were so glad we did, the location is wonderful; right in the middle of Chinatown and right next to the beautiful gate. There were tooons of food places nearby that were delicious, but honestly we ate and drank at the in house places the Pod had. We absolutely loved the fact that there was a rooftop bar (gorgeous view and chill vibe), a diner (gourmet food but honestly not bad pricing, was expecting worse but everything was like ~15), and a fantastic whiskey bar downstairs that was huge, had really nice booths and good music, and also food and great drinks. It was so convenient having everything there! But apart from the location, food, and convenience, the room was pretty small but the interior design was beautiful. The bed took up a lot of it, but there was a place to hang your things, a safe, a sliding door that covered either the small entry hallway or the bathroom, a desk, some nice lamps, a cute but quaint bathroom, and a huge tv. There was a little media hub next to the bed which had Bluetooth for music or hdmi inputs for laptops, consoles, etc (just not chromecast, ours didn’t work with the hotel wifi). Definitely bring a laptop to watch things bc it was honestly very nice to chill in the room during our downtime after a long day and after going to the bar or diner. The lighting was nice as well, and the bed had two little reading lights. All in all, a very homey, modern room. Also! The staff is super nice and welcoming. Otakon was an anime convention, so my boyfriend, friends and I were dressed up in some eclectic costumes. But they didn’t give us super judgey stares and one girl told us to have fun and enjoy our day! And she told other guests the con we were going to as well. During checkout they were very nice and helpful, also engaging in nice personal conversation and being super friendly. I took a short survey after, and just made one little comment about how the chromecast didn’t work and the hotel manager himself emailed me a hefty and kind response to my concern! I was amazed at the customer service and attention to detail they provided to me over a minuscule dissapointment. He said he’d look into getting it to work, and also introducing them into their next location in Philadelphia and I felt special. In the end, staying for three nights was a wonderful experience and we’re down to do it again! I definitely think if you’re only staying with one other person, this is the perfect place to go. A very modern, hip, and welcoming hotel with a great location, and convenient yet great bars/restaurants within."

It's just a place to sleep.Check in took a while to get together but they we're letting me into the room early so I can't complain.I opted for the bunk beds which is sorta weird and I debated sleeping on the top or bottom bunk by myself. I opted to move the ladder to the back of the bed after hitting my leg on it once (lol). Making the bottom bunk less *ahem* nautically claustrophobic. Still the rooms have a sleek and clean modern feel to them and it was just fine for a solo traveler. Also there's a metro station on the corner that allowed me to get around pretty easily.The bar/restaurant downstairs came in handy for when I wanted something to drink a night i needed a night cap. However I tried sitting down for breakfast at Crimson the first morning... after about 15 minutes I got impatient haven't not been greeted by a waiter yet and went to The Partisan instead.In summary great if you're cheap and spartan (as advertised). Nice central Chinatown location near the metro. Maybe avoid the restaurant if you don't have a lot of time on your hands.I was seeing a concert at the Capital One Arena so my search started with that area. Then I looked at prices. POD DC was very close and one of the better priced places. I started researching it a little bit and really loved their concept of not having wasted space. I started thinking about just how little I use the majority of the things and space in a hotel room. It’s not to have a spacious place, but it’s really not necessary usually. So we got there and the location was perfect. It’s right outside the Chinatown entryway. If you are there for the arena, you can walk there in 5 minutes. We left the arena and the crowd was still thinning out when we arrived at the hotel. That’s how close you are. And there are tons of great restaurants right there as well. We walked inside to check-in and the staff were very welcoming. They were even able to provide good restaurant tips. The lobby is small but very nice and has an attached restaurant. We stayed in a queen room which yes, the room was quite small. But it’s a perfect size. There are hooks and shelves throughout the room. The bathroom door doubles as another door in front of your main door (which is pretty cool and I had never seen before). There are some cool lights in your headboard. Everything is very well decorated. The design and colors are very nice. The wifi was great. The bed was super comfortable. Every employee we encountered throughout the stay was very friendly and welcoming. Check-out took about 30 seconds with zero hassle and the lady even asked unprompted if we needed to store bags or have a taxi called. I really really did enjoy my experience at this hotel and think they do a fantastic job."

My husband and I stayed in a queen pod while in town for the theatre. Space is somewhat tight, but very efficiently used. Bed is great. Bathroom has a good shower that, despite its small space is adequate for a large person. Good bathroom storage. Staff at the Pod is cheerful and helpful. We arrived at 10am, but were given a room right away (maybe because we had stated arrival time on pre-check in email form we completed). We came back one afternoon to find the room not yet made up, but needed to shower and leave early for the theatre. The staff accommodated immediately. Nice bar downstairs is a good place to meet friends. The price is right—hundreds cheaper than other hotels in DC!"

I really liked the location of the hotel, literally steps from the Gallery/Chinatown Metro station (a ride of only 30 minutes from DCA) and central to pretty much everything a tourist want to see in the Capital. The price point is also amazing, which is something my boss (who paid for this trip) was happy about.Pegs on the wall hold jackets or rain coats. There's a small closet cubby that has a room safe, a drawer and a cutout where you can store shoes & boots. The heating & air conditioning unit was super effective and probably too big for the tiny rooms. During my visit in the middle of summer, I think the thermostat was set to 68 by default and the room was freezing (I adjusted it up to 70 and things got dramatically better). I also sleep very well to noise and the air con fan helped very nicely with that. The fan doesn't appear to be able to run by itself though, so if it's running, it's heating or air conditioning.Speaking of noise, that's one of the cons. Hinted at in many of the other reviews, I'll explain the sounds I heard: drums. Lots of drums. One visitor on my hallway thought it was a Chinese style dragon drum line but actually it was simply non-Chinese street performers who had set up full drum kits nearby both nights I stayed. To their credit, I think the outside noisemakers stopped demonstrating various rhythms just after 10 p.m., but if you're trying to recover after a long Transatlantic flight, you might want to turn on the white noise devices the hotel has helpfully put into each of the rooms. I did appreciate the blackout curtains that slide down over the windows.The bathrooms are nicely sized for the room, but one thing people should be made aware of is that the bathroom door is of the sliding, thin opaque glass variety, meaning you need to be **very** comfortable with your partners bodily functions (and those noises) if you want to be able to sleep well. Turning on the light switch basically illuminates not only the bathroom, but also the entire room as well. There's a second light switch in the bathroom that doesn't do anything (none of the friendly front desk people I asked knew what the second switch was for, either). The attached restaurant downstairs doesn't open for breakfast until 7 a.m., and there was a collection of travelers waiting to get in when I arrived just before 7. They do serve breakfast all day so that’s nice.Because of the bathroom issues, I'd say Pods is super awesome for single travelers but couples probably need to evaluate their relationship status before they do a stay :-) I would not recommend Pods for a family with small children. If you find my notes and pictures helpful, definitely vote “helpful” below and help to motivate me to continue to contribute to TripAdvisor. Have a great stay in the area!"

Hotel is clean and modern. The rooms have ceiling to floor windows that help bring a lot of natural light. It is in a very good location, especially if you are attending an event at the Capital One Arena. Since it is in Chinatown, there are so many restaurants and bars/pubs to choose from. The Smithsonian Portrait and American Art Museum is around the corner. The hotel is located next to the Gallery Place Metro Stop and a few blocks away from Metro Center (which I used to walk to hotel instead of changing trains to Gallery Place).

The hotel provides clean, well presented accommodation in a fantastic location for exploring DC. 15 mins walk to the White House and a red and green line metro opposite. The red train is two stops from Union Station and costs 2 dollars plus 2 dollars for a new metro card.Rooms are small, as described, and the doubles are 4ft,6in beds. Queen beds are extra. Bathroom is a shower room, again small but well appointed. There's enough room for med size cases, just about. Beds are comfortable with great fluffy pillows. You can open the window a few inches for air and the air-conditioning is effective, but loud. The location, aircon and extractor fan in the bathroom, plus street noise, means it's not exactly quiet, but we still managed to tune out and sleep well.The onsite bar, restaurant is quite expensive, so we ate breakfast at the corner bakery cafe left out of door and on the corner of the next intersection. Opposite the cafe is Chinatown express for no frills good quality Chinese food. There's also a Matchbox pizza place turn right out of hotel and on the right on the next block. Hotel has an interesting rooftop bar with views and you can visit without drinking. The only thing missing is tea and coffee making facilities.

I had never heard of pod until I used Jet Blue as an alternative method to book a hotel.I saw the pictures and reviews and thought, ""What the hell, why not!""When I checked in the staff was thorough and courteous. I got to my room, which was a single Queen, and was surprised at the simplicity of the layout. I looked for the dresser and other amenities that I was accustomed to seeing in a hotel. I quickly realized this was not it. I unpacked, put some clothes on the shelves and hung up my shirts and pants. I chuckled a bit thinking that I got what I paid for.Now you are thinking that this is a bad review, but I am here to tell you that it was the best experience that I have ever had traveling. Because the room was minimalist I was forced to spend more time out of my room which gave me opportunity to meet Jeff the Barista and many of the other staff members throughout my stay. The wonderful wait staff in the restaurant, the overwhelming assortment of whisky downstairs, and the beautiful atmosphere of the rooftop bar and social area. I posted some pictures my last night there.Besides the wonderful staff I also struck up conversations with many people because it was a very diverse group of not only travelers but locals as well. The construction workers from down the street, the regular customer that comes in for breakfast, both young and old arriving at the rooftop to meet total strangers and engage in a way that made me feel quite welcome in DC.I'm 58, not well traveled, gray beard, in DC on business. This experience has shown me that my age and beard color had no bearing on feeling just like everyone else. It was refreshing, I met some great people and exchanged business cards with total strangers so when I return to DC pod again I can call them up and have them meet me at the roof top bar for drinks and to catch up.Thank you for such a wonderful experience!First rooms are small. They are very clean comfortable but small. Staff was very nice. Neat bar on top. Everything I looked at was 2x the price of the pod. We were very happy to stay there. We even had friends move there from another hotel."

Such a convenient location. It was particularly useful for our return flight which was early at 7:30am and we caught the 5:30am train back to the airport which was only 5 train stops away.From the hotel, we walked to the White House (10 mins) and from there to the Washington Monument and the National Mall. In fact, we did not have to rely on the metro at all, so strategic was the hotel location. There were numerous food choices around the hotel (the 88 pho place across the road was excellent) and there was a Walgreen outlet just next to the hotel.The room was small but sufficiently comfortable. We were there only for a good night's rest and had no major complaints. The heater was a bit noisy and maybe some coffee-making facility in the room might be good. Anyway, the wifi download speed was very fast, so that was a boon. We were there for 2 nights and noticed the front desk personnel worked long hours. That could be why they appeared just functional in their approach to their job. That is not to say they were rude or dismissive, but the friendly touch was missing. It could also be due to the on-line check in process which was quick and easy, and made the human connection unnecessary. Our queries were met with ""it's on the website/notice"" sort of response - which I am sure is true. But still... and don't ask for directions. It's on the map. Overall, this is a fantastic hotel and I would stay here again. Would recommend for the modern traveler who appreciates efficiency and practicality."

Since the metro is right there it is a great way to travel around the city ... make sure to use the red circular to tour around the national mall no need for the expensive big bus tours. Capital arena is right here also and many museums like the national Portrait museum and the international spy Museum In walking distance ....also places to shop in the area...the price is amazing really for all the benefits. Safe and cozy for us gals. Super clean and modern bathroom inside room...huge plus compared to pod 51 in nyc."

I was apprehensive about staying in a pod hotel because the room size, but after meeting the pod squad at check-in I knew I made the right choice. Bernard at check-in was absolutely amazing and made me feel right at home. Location is great,walking distance to restaurants and shops. The room and hotel grounds were clean. The room is small but we were out on the town most of the day and night. The rooftop bar had an amazing view and attentive bartenders. The diner food was delicious and stayed open until 1am. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again for a weekend. Every staff member and server I encountered provided top notch service. Can't wait to return. The only negative is the mattress, very firm and uncomfortable.You get off at the Gallery Place Chinatown Metro station and then the hotel is just a few steps away. I needed a place where I could make it easily to the Union station to take a 6:30 AM train to New York. This hotel was perfect, and at a low price. The room was small, reminded me about hotel rooms in Japan. However, the room was comfortable and I was able to sleep well. The first hotel where I find a station for filling up water bottles. There are many restaurants nearby. The wi-fi worked well no complaints.Loved this hotel - the rooms are quaint, clean, and compact, bright, and airy. There isn't a lot of extra floorspace, but that's the idea. I chose this hotel because I liked the concept of small rooms, and they delivered beyond my expectations. The frosted glass sliding door for the bathroom helped keep the open feel of the space while still providing privacy. The tall ceilings kept the room feeling big. Additional touches like the headboard lights, recessed shelving in the bathroom, and backlit mirror maximized the space. The local area is alive with activity and interest, a short walk from the National Mall, lots of eateries, metro nearby. The restaurant at the hotel was delicious. The fitness room was well equipped. The staff was very friendly."

The Metrorail station was right across the street, and there was a CVS on the corner. Very convenient to everything you want to see in DC. I took the MetroRail from Reagan Airport with no problem. The front desk staff are outstanding, super helpful, and friendly! I arrived at around 10am and my check in wasn’t until about 3 or 4, and they got me a room in the front of the building with a great view (I could see the Washington Monument in the distance from room 1119). Also my early check in and late check out (one hour late) was complimentary! The breakfast in the diner in the hotel was fantastic, I wish I had tried it for lunch or dinner as well. I also didn’t have a chance to check out the rooftop or Whiskey Bar. On Sunday before I left, I went on the walking tour the front desk offered of China Town, and it wasn’t just of China Town; we walked over to the Ford Theater and the Smithsonian Portrait and Art Museum (if you don’t go into the museum, the courtyard is something to see). The tour is free, but please tip the tour guide, he is awesome, and super knowledgeable! The room was exactly what I expected, bed was very comfortable, the bathroom had a sliding door for separation from the bedroom. There was also a safe, and a metal bar to hang clothes or coats in the doorway. There were also coat hooks behind the door. The TV worked just fine with cable. I have seen some reviews complain about how this is a simple room with no closet, or in room amenities… It’s a POD room… what did you expect? No, it is not the Ritz, but it is perfect for a traveler who will spend little to no time in their hotel room. May not be the best if you are traveling for a week with kids since there is no seating area other than a small desk and chair. But on the other hand it might be just perfect if you will be out and about all day and only plan on sleeping in your room. This place was awesome, and I wish there was a POD hotel in every city… if there was, and the location fit my needs, I’d be staying there."

Uber/lyft is availale. I never spent more than 6 dollars on lyft. Near a lot of bars (over priced unless during happy hr) and resturants. They give you access to the gym across the street. The gym has group fitness classes and a sauna. Inside the hotel is a very cool whisky bar, coffee bar, diner and rooftop bar. You literally never need to leave the block for fun. The rooms are tiny as pictured. No where to unpack your clothes, no microwave or fridge, no ice machine etc. Very basic CLEAN room with cable and a safe. The rating is so high because of the location mostly. I would definitely stay here again. Its perfect for one person or two really close friends."

It may even be to small to share with a spouse. The rooms are new and clean. There’s a restaurant and bar on the first floor. The price was very reasonable for the area.

Room (I had a queen bed) was simple, quiet, comfortable & sparsely furnished...and small (enough space to walk around the bed but not much more. It reminded me very much of a Japanese business hotel, without the slippers. Only complaint: All the toiletries (hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash--if in fact the body wash was different from the shampoo, which I'm not sure it was) had a really strong lemon scent. I have no objection to scented soaps, but I had no interest in walking around all day smelling like an explosion of lemon joy dishwashing soap."

This is in my top 5. Loved the location, in DC's Chinatown. It was literally right across the street from Metro and a few blocks from the Portrait Gallery. The staff was awesome. The room, while small, was comfortable, very clean and really nice. LOVED the roof bar and the view all the way to the Washington Monument. Lots of good restaurants nearby. Union Station is only 2 metro stops away.The name POD suggested that the rooms very going to be on the small side, however they were perfectly acceptable for the two of us and luggage for our four night stay. The bathroom was also compact but once again very acceptable. There were great space saving ideas like the hairdrier with a retractable power cable, a small detail but useful. The staff were very friendly and exceptionally helpful. Location was great, all the major attractions were within walking distance, as were the restaurants. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and they were excellent and reasonably priced, the menu was varied and interesting with very friendly and helpful staff. The only minor criticism I had was about access to the roof bar, I wanted to go up in the dedicated lift but was refused access to the lift until I presented photo ID, for us in the UK this is unknown. When I presented photo ID I asked why this was necessary and was only told its a requirement, strange.From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out everything was excellent. Although our room was on the 8th floor, there was never a wait for any of the three elevators. The room was small, as advertised and expected. However, it was well designed and maximized every inch...plenty of space for hang-ups and suitcase storage. The decor was simple but trendy. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom shower was nice sized. There were also plenty of wall receptacles and a built-in safe.. As for cleanliness, this was by far the cleanest hotel my wife and I have ever stayed in...at home or abroad. There was a coffee bar and restaurant adjacent to the front desk on the ground floor, and a bar downstairs. In addition, there was an outdoor ""Penthouse"" bar that was accessible by elevator. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of several good specialty and chain restaurants, as well as a number of museums and other places of interest. As for transportation, the Metro is just across the street and taxis are everywhere. To top things off, the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful...making guests feel like family. Hopefully, I won't leave out any names here. Forgive me if I do. But, kudos to Kiana, Destini, Tea, Adrian, Joe, and Bernard. You made our trip to Washington D.C. even more special than expected. Thank you so much!!"

Great location! Great value! ,"In writing this review the ""very good"" refers to what you get for the money in a high priced area. From start to finish, Pod DC does a great job, but you need to keep in mind that it is a ""budget"" hotel with relatively few frills. The front desk staff is efficient and helpful.I was warned by a Washington resident that the hotel can be very loud on weekends, because of the nearby stadium. My stay was Sunday night thru Thursday morning. Ironically, the noise problem I encountered was early morning. My room 306 was in the back (over the dumpsters). Garbage was picked up every morning between 4 AM and 6 AM with back-up beeping, clanging and banging. The duration of the noise was limited, but it woke me several times.The other quibble is that I like HOT showers. The first night, I had to run the water a long time to get what I consider to be lukewarm water. Only on the last night of 4 did the water come close to the heat that like.The room is compact, but well designed and very clean. The floors are ""wood style"" or tile. The room is very well lit. The internet connection is good and there is a large flat screen TV. The toiletries are limited to large containers of hand soap, body wash, shampoo and conditioner. The towels are adequate and replaced if you put them on the floor. The bed is made-up daily, but there was a note on the bed saying that the linens would not be changed for the duration of my stay.There is a tiny, but usable desk on one side of the bed. There are only 4 hangers and none with clips. If you need to hang something full-length, there are 3 large ""hooks"" in the entrance area. As on a cruise ship, suitcases can be slid under the bed.The lighting in the room was excellent."

Perfect for what I needed since I was in DC for work. Very friendly staff. I have stayed in the NYC Pods a few times so I thought I'd give it a try. Very happy that I did. Only a 10 minute walk to the convention center and across the street from the metro. Also, its in walking distance to most DC attractions.Stayed in Pod hotel for 3 nights when i was in DC for sightseeing. It's a decent location right smack in Chinatown and just 10 metres away from the subway. It's relatively close and of walking distance to the place of interests such as national mall, capitol building. However, the room is really small and because it's insanely noisy even at night. During my stay, there was some construction going on at the roadside from early morning and thus it really drives you crazy with the noises. Next, the wifi in the hotel is not stable and most of the time (95%) is not working. You can be spending hours just trying to get a connection. The hot water in the shower room is scaldingly hot and there is no way you can adjust the temperature. All in all, i will probably not stay in this hotel again."

This hotel is central to all tourist locations. Train entrance right in front of hotel. Only complaint was two night lights that were broken and the only way to fix it was by staff was by rigging it with a piece of paper.I firmly enjoyed my stay in the hotel. If you travel on a budget this is the place to stay. The rooms are cheap, but yet you get good value for your money. The bed is nice the room is clean and you have few usb charger in a room which should be but unfortunately is not the norm yet. I would have been absolutely happy with the place, but there were 2 issues I couldn’t ignore. The first one was the bathroom fan. Every time I did enter the room it did switched on and no matter what I tried it never switched off. As the bathroom is right next to the bed this could become very irritating. The second was the air-con or rather that truck which was right next to the bed and randomly decided to switch on. Honestly I never heard anything more loudly than this in a room. First I thought it’s just my room but anyone I talked to had the very same issue."

I booked a room with a double bed for myself based on reading the Trip Advisor reviews. I don't think I would go smaller. That said, the room had everything that I could want except a chair for reading. If I was in the room as part of a couple, it may have been a bit too tight. For one person, it worked (except for a good chair).Importantly, the location is excellent and the room included a comfortable bed, excellent WIFI, good lighting and a nice bathroom. The bathroom is small but was actually larger than the one that I had at a Courtyard in SF. The room also included an in-room safe.For my short-term stay in DC, this was an excellent choice and one that I likely will use in the future (as long as some of the larger rooms are available).Very nice front desk staff. The hotel was only two months old when I stayed and still had that ""new building"" feel."

However, I guess the ""micro-hotel"" concept causes the Pod to lack some things that I feel are necessities and that is why I couldn't give it more than 3 stars.First, I was told that they do not have provide ice. And I was actually told that I could go to the Panera Bread next door and get ice lol. Somehow I got to talking to someone outside of the hotel on my way to Panera and they told me that the Walgreens a couple doors down from Panera has ice so I ended up buying a bag of ice each day during my 3 day stay and putting it in the sink in the room. I don't mind improvising when necessary but I wasn't too fond of spending $7 on ice during my trip when I already paid $179 per day to stay at the Pod. I like ice in all of my beverages so this is important to me but may not be as important to you.Next, when I got back to the room after going to work the first day, I noticed that they did not bring me any clean towels, which I thought was common protocol for all hotels. I can understand if I hung all of the towels over the shower rail to symbolize that I don't mind using them again but they left the dirty towels on the floor and even took the towel that I left on the bed that morning and draped it over the chair lmao. And still made the bed!! I was disappointed but still had to laugh at that. I had to leave notes on the bed and sink the next morning to remind them to bring clean towels (see images), and they complied when I did that. The thing is that guests shouldn't have to do that. One other quirky thing about the Pod room is that the light works on a sensor so if you sit still for like 5 minutes it cuts off. I was able to slide the door that covers the bathroom over to the hall to block the sensor so the light would stay off at night but after a day or so I found a switch on the wall by the bed that lets you turn the light off at night. I did ask for an iron the first day and they brought me one and a full sized ironing board that they left in the room for the duration of my stay so I appreciated that. The main thing to know and the website may say it but the rooms are not big at all. I was in a Queen pod so the bed was a queen size and there are no closets in the room - only an area by the door where you can hang some things but right below that is a drawer that has a safe on top. My room also had a view of wall of the building right next to the hotel and that was it so if you desire a room with a good view then ask for a room on the front or right side of the hotel but I didn't really care too much about the view. would recommend this hotel for business travelers or people staying alone but I did not find this hotel appealing for families.It is great when you are traveling on a tight budget to find a place that makes you feel like you are in a much more expensive place.The beautiful decor, the great service and the cleanliness.The catch? Tiny room, but well thoughtout, location in Chinatown, which could be seen as a plus, depending where you are going."

Check-in was quick & easy, and was given a choice of rooms on the 9th floor. I chose 908, facing the back, off the street with a glimpse of the top of the Washington Monument. Definitely limited space, but all I really want is a clean room with WiFi. Minimalistic room with clean lines and a big, comfy bed and big TV. Had a very small wheelie bag which didn't fit on the shelf and blocked the walkway if on the floor - something to consider if you're not alone (you'll have to put your luggage on the bed to walk around). Could not be in a better location - directly across the street from the Chinatown metro stop (red line), and there's a Starbucks, Panera Bread, Walgreen's and Nando's within 1 block from the hotel. First time there cost me $83.56 and will definitely stay in the future rather than at my friend's."

This was the best decision I could have made. The hotel looks like it has been recently renovated, so the room and bathroom were updated, modern, and clean. Service was excellent; on my last day, I ordered room service for breakfast on the in-room tablet and it arrived within less than 30 minutes. Check in and check out was made extremely simple and fast with the help of Simon Attagba at the front desk. Mr. Attagba was extremely kind, knowledgeable, and added to my overall pleasant stay. After looking at other reviews and looking at my receipt on Trip Advisor, I saw the fees that would be due at checkout and a receipt was slipped under my door the night before I checked out, so I'm not sure why everyone else was shocked by the ""service fee."" Also, I would have been willing to pay the fees anyway because I definitely got what I paid for at this hotel. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're staying in DC.I booked room through TripAdvisor/Cancelon - no issues at check-in. Beautiful Lobby area.

This hotel is a nightmare! Things went wrong immediately upon arrival. My room had several long hairs on the mirror, hair in the bath tub and sink, and some kind of pet hair or fur on the duvet of one of the beds. Surfaces above the bed were dusty, clearly not having been wiped in a long time. I called downstairs, informed them of the cleaning issues, and was told someone would be up to clean the room. I waited for a half hour, and no one arrived. I was eager to lay down after a long trip, so I didn't want to wait longer to have the room cleaned properly. I went downstairs and informed the manager of the issue, and asked him to come up and see what I was referring to. He was pleasant, and seemed apologetic. I showed him the issues and he sent someone up, though it took another 20 minutes or so. Aside from the cleanliness issues, the room is less than what I would expect for this star rating and price point. The bed bases are beat up and scratched up, paint throughout the room is peeling off the walls. Painting is inexpensive, so I am not sure why the management has decided it's not worth the $50 or so it would cost to correct this.After settling into my room, I wanted to get something to eat, but was informed that none of the eateries in the hotel were open. It was around 2:30 and they said the restaurant opens at 4 for dinner. The cafe attached to the front of the hotel was never open, during the entirety of my stay, so there was nowhere on site to get a snack or a cup of coffee during the times their restaurant is closed. Not exactly 4 star convenience, if you ask me. The cleaning service during the stay leaves much to be desired. No surfaces are wiped. I know this because the crumbs from yesterday's pretzel snack are still there on my night stand. The shower stall literally had black shoe tracks left in it. The toilet was dirty. Hair was not wiped off the sink top. And they're charging nearly $500/night for this? It is not too much to ask that your room be properly cleaned when you are paying that much!When I did have the occasion to dine in the hotel's restaurant, it was an underwhelming experience. At around 12:30, the restaurant was empty, but I was greeted by 2 hostesses. I was seated and told my server would be right with me. About 5 minutes later, someone came set down some bread, and poured water, without saying a word. I couldn't tell if that was my server or not, as they didn't say anything to me at all. After another 10 minutes or so, when no one approached me, I waived down the man who brought bread and water and said I was ready to put in my order. He said he was not the server. I asked why there was no server, when there was only one other table seated in the restaurant at the time. I was informed, rather rudely, that the server was also the bartender and he was making drinks in the bar across the lobby. I don't understand why there was only one server scheduled and this server also had to perform bartender duties at a bar clear across the lobby. Two hostesses but one part-time server? Strange staffing decisions for a hotel located in the heart of the nation's capital, especially when this hotel is hosting a conference. Why couldn't a hostess take an order? As I was sitting at lunch, I discovered on my bank statement that my card had been charged for the entirety of my stay. This was surprising, given that I am not checking out until tomorrow. I went to the front desk to inquire. I was told, rudely and impatiently, that this charge was necessary, ""in case you decide to leave and not pay us."" I told the front desk person that I was used to my card being charged for an incidentals amount, usually up to $500, and then the final charges applied after checkout. He informed me that this was not how this hotel works, and not how hotels in Washington DC work. I was in the process of telling him that I was not happy with multiple aspects of my stay, at which point he started to interrupt me, and tell me that I was insulting him. I clarified that I did not insult him personally, did not call him any names, and did not say anything about him as an individual, but rather, I was providing feedback about my stay at this hotel. I asked to speak to a manager, and was told one would not be here until after 3 pm. I am not sure how a hotel operates without a manager on duty in the middle of the day! I asked to call the manager and was told that was impossible and I could speak to him after 3 only. The gentlemen then turned to the next customer and asked how he could help her. I asked him if he was going to ignore me, to which he responded, ""Yes I am, because you keep repeating yourself."" I was going to ask him to switch my charge to a credit card, but we never got that far because he continued to act like I was no longer there. This is the most unapologetically rude customer service experience I have ever had at a hotel. I am a frequent traveler for business, and despite the fact that my organization annually gets a room block at this hotel for our lobby trip, I will not be staying here again. Furthermore, I will be providing feedback regarding my stay to our organization and asking them to seek other accommodations for next year. I am confident this kind of service would be unacceptable at the Hyatt across the street, and next time, I will be taking my business there."

Unfortunately, no coffee maker and no writing desk. The hotel also has a fitness room with a decent selection of cardio and weights. What really attracted me to stay here was the location.

Secondly, I drove to D.C. and knew once in the city my car would remained parked until I left. At first looking on the WCH website I saw parking was a ridiculous $50+ a night, not at all uncommon for D.C. I then looked at the hotel's special packages which included parking at a much more reasonable rate. So I happily booked.I was very well pleased with the hotel. My room featured a large 55"" television, mini-refrigerator, and plenty of plugs for electronics. The large shower featured nice toiletries as well as a fogless mirror. Elevators were quick and I was able to keep my car parked until 6 p.m. following a noon check-out. I found the staff friendly and helpful and experienced no issues during my stay. Had I known how convenient the hotel's location was I would have stayed longer. Finally, with my parking package, I felt the Washington Court was a great value for D.C."

Please note that the hotel is currently undergoing a bit of a remodel, which is where many of the negative comments are coming from. During this time the restaurant and lobby bar are not open, but there are plenty of choices nearby the hotel. This was my second time staying at the hotel and it was even better than the first. I stayed at the hotel over the New Years weekend, so naturally it was a bit quiet and empty as most people head out of the city for the holiday. I got a great rate using Hotel Tonight and was given a HUGE corner room on the top floor (16th). The room was very comfortable, quiet and spacious. I was shocked at the quality of the room for the price that I paid. The room was very clean and the bedding was very comfortable. Staff was friendly and very helpful throughout my stay. I am sure that the hotel will only get better as the remodel is finished, but I would recommend the hotel and will be staying again. My only complaints if I had to put any is that the free WIFI is pretty slow but it worked well enough to not need to upgrade to the high speed option which they charge for. In addition, the towels were all pretty small but that is if I am fishing for something to complain about. Looking forward to going back!"

Other guests told us they'd reported the same problems, and staff told us the issue has been referred up to management *many* times-- but nothing has ever been done. Come on! It's not a big deal to upgrade so there's adequate service-- management just has to care enough. Also, the bathroom was nicely appointed-- but the grout was filthy.

The room was clean and comfortable. Staff very accommodating. Location was perfect for me as I was spending days lobbying Congress so I was right on the Hill.We had a room on the top floor facing the Capitol and that was just lovely.The beds were very comfortable.

On the other hand, to the north and west are soup kitchens and convenience stores with cages. DO NOT LET THIS BOTHER YOU!Our family of 4 stayed here for a training and lobbying event. Only a 5-minute walk from Union Station or the Capitol. Convenient walk to museums, monuments, Verizon Center, Ford's Theatre, and other spots. Cabs always available out front. Great view of the Capitol and DC skyline from our room. Our room was spacious and the hotel service fabulous. The meeting spaces worked well and meals were yummy.

It was close to the Union Station, about a five minute walk. The distance with walking towards the Mall of museums weren't bad. It was a nice spot. Service: So, my friends and I wanted to do a Girls Weekend in D.C. we researched and found the Washington Court and thought the price was decent for the three nights stay we had. We booked this between February and April...for the end of July early August. We asked for adjoining rooms or rooms that was next door or across the hall... you would think with booking this in advanced and asking for basic accommodation like this would give the hotel a heads up and prepare this for us, but nope. Unfortunately, the hotel did not fulfill our request. There's NO point in asking if we want specific things if there's no way of providing it. The credibility goes south. -The Housekeeper kept the rooms clean.-The doormen were extremely nice.-The registration people were nice and helpful. -Also, once we received our bill during check out, it was cheaper than what we originally paid to book it. We did it through Expedia and we asked the registration table about it...but they said that's how the second party makes their commission, but from my experience booking with another party to a hotel, it's less expensive than the hotel's price or it matched... it didn't make sense. We didn't out up a fight with them.Décor: The hotel was spacious. It just felt so outdated with the furniture, the style, no refrigerator in the rooms. The toilet were extremely slow. The pressure sucked. We thought we broke it a few times. The beds were okay. Overall, my friends and I agreed to give the hotel a 2.5 rating out of five. It was a good location but lacked a lot of little details. If you're planning on leaving the hotel all day this isn't a bad hotel... but if you're trying to lounge around... choose another one."

If we had booked in 2013 there is no way we could have afforded such a fabulous hotel - our friends went for a run of the mill ""one of these in every city"" hotel - you know where to find the bar etc, they all look the same. We got the Washington Court - a one off in one of the best locations. We got allocated a room on the 15th floor - if I had of been offer something lower than floor 10 I would have requested a change (it's a devil to get the lift to stop and have room on those lower floors plus it's peaceful even in a city). Imagine our surprise when we get out of the lift (glass - always impressive) and go to our room when we see a beautiful view of the Capital - the builders knew a thing or two when they put a window in the corridor at that spot. Our friends in the ""you know the name"" hotel had a view of a VERY close office block even though they had been under the impression that they would be able to see The White House (I don't think any hotel has that view?). Our room, 1504, was large airy and beautifully decorated - the bathroom was big enough to have friends round! The bed and linen was top notch - somewhat strange idea of using a sheet as a duvet (comforter) cover but the bed was made everyday and I didn't have to worry about how they managed it. We ate in the hotel just once in 7 nights (sorry we were busy each day and ate on the hoof many times) - it was fine, somewhat strange from the US, felt it could have been France not DC, I always assume meals in the US come with fries and to get a steak served with brussel sprouts was somewhat weird. It was a tad on the expensive side but not too bad - the wine was advertised as a US wine (we try to drink local when away) but was actually from Argentina or Chile but bottled in the US - don't think that counts - they bottle wine from Australia in Norwich but that doesn't make it Norfolk wine.

Loved the bathrooms with the separate shower and bathtub. The restaurant was very good and the kids really enjoyed the items on the kids menu - and the price for kids meals was the best deal in DC. The location of the hotel really made the trip. We were able to walk to the Capitol, the various Smithsonian museums, and the Monuments very easily and quickly - which was very important when you have 3 kids with you.

My husband and I prefer a thinner pillow. These raised our head up higher from the mattress. In the future I would ask for different pillows. Just a personal preference.There is free wifi but it is only in the lobby.There is free coffee outside the dining room, but I thought it was not very good. Again my personal opinion.There is only valet parking at approx. $32 per day.Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with nice rooms, therefore, I would stay there again."

Fortunately the bell boy (Italian or Spanish name I think) made up for the lack of people skills at reception, he could not do enough for you- fantastic guy. This hotel is in the surrounded by offices and when I looked down form the glass lift I saw some rooms overlooking the courtyard skylight with obviously no view and little privacy. Book early and request a room on a high floor overlooking capitol hill. The rooms are spacious with two beds and a window that can open for fresh air. Decent coffee maker, bath shower, etc nothing to complain about. Like many hotels in the USA free wi-fi is only available in the lobby. I hope management will consider free Wi-Fi in the rooms as this would make the hotel one of the best for location and amenities."

The front desk check-in was quick. The room 905 with a front view as requested was well kept and impressive and in sync with our expectations. The King sized bed was great and was very comfortable, which made staying three nights quite good and affordable. Could stay a few days more for the comfort and proximity to key sightseeing areas. Excellent location, proximity with the Union Station and the Capitol Hill and a close walk to the Botanical Gardens reinforced our decision to stay in this hotel. I would definitely stay at the Washington Court again.It was a sheer delight to check in the Washington Court Hotel after a tiring and exhausting day, traveling and sightseeing in Philadelphia. I along with my spouse was excited to have booked a reservation in this hotel from among the several other recommended hotels in DC. It was well within our budget and very cost-effective for three nights. It met with all the criteria and expectations on our first vacation to Washington DC. Primarily, situated a few blocks away from Union Station, where we were to arrive from Philadelphia by Megabus late 19th August night, as well as its central location near the prestigious historic Capitol Hill, played an important part in my decision to select this hotel. To me, easy access to the National Mall, Botanical garden, renowned Monuments, free Museums and the U.S. Capitol was important especially since it was value for money!! The Hotel is excellent for the price. The staff were courteous and polite that gives one an awesome experience of what hospitality to expect after check-in. We could feel the luxury of staying in this hotel surrounded by world-class historical monuments of Washington DC, complete with marble bathrooms, well-lit vanities, and hi-tech flat-screen TV and high-speed wireless Internet access. I wish my children with their families take the opportunity to enjoy all of this and more...certainly a great experience.. I will surely opt stay here again."

Though primarily a business hotel (some conferences were in progress while we were there) I was pleasantly surprised to discover how child-friendly it was. The doormen were pleasant and spent time talking with him and he just loved the breakfast buffet (kids eat for 1/2 price.) I found all of the staff friendly and courteous; spilled milk was met with a smile and ""No problem."" Our room was large, the beds comfortable with plenty of pillows, the showers good and hot. I'd chosen the hotel based on location; it is about two blocks from Union Station and we'd come by train from NC. It is also conveniently situated close to the Capitol building and National Mall. This was my grandson's first visit to DC and we made the most of it, visiting museums, the Lincoln Memorial and the Zoo. The area felt safe and the Washington Court provided us with a good base for our explorations.Stayed 5 nights. Room was a good size and comfortable. Bar and restaurant were adequate. Room needed a few more amenities... No safe, no mini-fridge, no hotel service directory. Internet access is pretty slow and pricey. Great location...

The service was great from the moment we arrived with a terrific doorman and valet. Check-in was easy and the room was comfortable. The hotel is a little pricey, but expected due to it's location. Room service was timely and breakfast was good. (never ate dinner in the hotel). Breakfast buffet is available, but we had ala carte and it was fine. Lobby bar was small, but service was prompt and there were always a few people around. Drinks are again pricey, but expected.Very easy walk to National Mall and all surrounding sights and attractions. Extremely great location if you're visiting Georgetown Law School (it's across the street).Parking is expensive,($43.00 overnight) but there really isn't anywhere to park if you want to stay this close to the Capitol. Parking in close by garages cost about the same. Overall a very nice stay and I would go back when visiting my son."

My name was somehow typo'ed from the get go and even though I sent an email to the hotel re: that; no response was made. When I checked in the clerk was very irritated that I was Dawn and not Owen. I'd had a tumultuous week and was looking forward to relaxing but he was so unfriendly it just felt like one more thing and I was sure my visit was going to be a depressing disaster. However I never had to deal with the front desk again and found the bartender, the doorman, valets, and (especially) my waiter for dinner to be charming and hospitable. It's a beautiful hotel and close to the Capitol, The Botanical Gardens, and Union Station so that was different than my usual haunts near DuPont Circle or the Waterfront.It’s a beautiful hotel and if you can get a deal for around $100.00 it’s not too bad. But then add parking, internet, and the location (unless you are visiting one of the places I mentioned) and it’s not that great of a deal.

Showers walls and glass looked as if it had human fluids etc. NASTY!!!!!

The hotel was central to everything I wanted to see and walking distance from Union Station.Beautiful entry, very friendly and helpful staff at the front desk, he was more than happy to give me directions.

I usually try for a combination of good value over economy or splurge. And subsequently I have been disappointed in many. But the Washington Court Hotel does not inspire complaint. Besides the generally high quality of the facility and the friendliness, helpfulness of the staff, I liked the location near the train station, which gives you Metro access (~3 blocks from the front door), good parking and quick places to eat - including Indian! - when you arrive or depart. The service was great, the room was clean and quiet except for the wailing fire department, dependably awaking you at odd hours. If so inclined, you can get a room with a view of the Capitol (photo attached) if you go up over I think floor 12. I did get a very good price through a third party bidding service (the one formerly sponsored by a fake ex-space captain), so I don't really know if you will find the price/value as satisfying as I found it. Regarding internet access, you can get a code to use it for free in the lobby instead of paying a too-high rate. And if you are lucky, you might be provided with another free code for the room.... ;-)"

Incredible!,"My stay at the Washington Court Hotel was amazing. This is by far the BEST hotel that I have ever stayed in. Their website says that they will impress, and they do. The communication by email with Adam Helldorfer before and after my stay was on point. I had many questions, and he was always very timely with his response. Check in was simple, valet was helpful and quick, the room was immaculately clean (even though I am tough to please). It was a wonderfully spacious room, and we got the most basic room with a king sized bed. Water pressure in the shower was very strong and the toilet flushed well. The room service for breakfast was well worth $9/$11 that they charge (big servings) and the room service staff was very friendly and accommodating. They allowed me to bring my 15 pound dog with no issues, it was great. I was worried that the room they may have put us in would have been less than par because they have specific rooms for dog owners. That was not the case, this room was very clean and even smelled nice. The gym is the best hotel gym I have ever seen, great choices of equipmentand weights!!! The lobby is very impressive and the Bistro 525 downstairs was AMAZING. Great food and service. It was quiet and had private feel to it. Perfect for my husband and I. I only have two complaints. First, I asked that they put a refrigerator in my room; I confirmed by phone twice before my arrival and was told upon check in that it would be taken care of. My refrigerator never arrived. Alas, I had brought my cooler and used their ice. Secondly, we continuously had the “privacy please” sign up during our stay, and despite this fact, staff walked into our room twice during our stay while we were in the room. I do not think they meant to, but the sign was clearly up and on the proper side (the other side of the sign says “service please”). Other than those two things, I cannot complain. I love it here! And I plan to return when I go to DC again. Thank you Washington Court!"

Got a fantastic deal on BookIt. I had Rm 616 which faced an office building across the roof of the lobby and restaurant. No view, but didn't feel closed in. Room was very clean. Comfortable easy chair and ottoman with a light next to it for reading or watching TV. TV reception was grainy on several stations. Bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of drawers in room. Bathroom was very large and open. Glass doors on shower/tub were heavy. I have short legs and did find the door sill on the tub high and a little awkward to step over. Plenty of towels. Excellent lighting. Room was quiet. Fitness room was a little cramped, but had more types of equipment than I have seen in a hotel. Never had a wait for the elevators.  The only issue I had was a broken bottom drawer which wouldn't close. I notified the front desk, that it was sticking out, but unfortunately they didn't send anyone to fix it and during the nite, I bumped into and bruised my leg. The next morning when housekeeping came, I warned her to be careful. She left and within 5 minutes, there was a man fixing the drawer.  There are a few pubs and restaurants in the area, and I found a deli just around the corner with good prices and large sandwiches and salads. During the week, 1 block over there is a long line of food trucks, which seemed to be very popular with businesses. Altogether, I really loved the hotel and location. Would definitely go again."

Housekeeping did a great job each day and left even a nice note thanking us for the tips. Locationwise, the hotel has a perfect spot to all the sites. Its only a few blocks to union stations where you can catch the metro going every direction, including Arlington. It is also only a few blocks walk to the Mall and to one of the Bike the sites-bike rentals which I can highly recommend to do for at least one day you're in Washington. We also tried out the room service, it was quick and the food was good, though perhaps a little on the pricey side. In all, great hotel to stay at.This was a our second time staying here in the last year - this time was again for a single night.Spent more time at the bar area. The wings were great - sauce was on the side - very spicy and excellent. Drinks were perfect. Ate at Bistro 555 - it was good. Empty the night we were there - but good.Room is very clean. Pretty quiet - though some sirens came up. Had a great view of the capital at night. Stayed in a single room this time, instead of the suite.One complaint was the shower. Very nice design with dual shower heads on opposite sides. very spacious. However the water temperature was all but impossible to control. Could not get hot water, just wamr at best - and that was with a lot of playing around.Still - this is a great hotel. Staff is very attentive. Stay here and enjoy!"

My kids came with us so shortly upon arrival two rollaway beds were brought in and set up side by side still leaving plenty of space.

Maids knock on door asking to clean the room at 9:00 am when I had my do not disturb sign on. Good luck going back to sleep after that. You want internet?? That's $ 10 and excruciatingly slow, let's just say that the internet on the plane (GoGo) was 3 times as fast. And this is a $ 300+/night room!!! So I wake up, open the curtains and find a bug the size of my cufflink sitting there. I took a picture showing the REALTOR building across the street so you can see I wasn't using some other random bug picture. No, I never opened the window (didn't even try).

The main reason we chose this hotel was for the location. It was also a great price, considering how close it was to everything!Check in was smooth. The man at the front desk was VERY nice. When we booked the hotel, we had made a comment that we were celebrating our anniversary and that we would love a great view. The clerk told us we had a view of the Capitol and wished us a happy anniversary! He was very professional and went above and beyond his job!The hotel itself is nice. To me, the colors are really ""blah."" Everything is just really plain and dull. A little outdated. That's ok though, it's just looks. Our room was on the 14th floor I believe. When we walked in, we saw that we had a really great view of the Capitol! It was awesome. The room was decent. It's very ""manly"" looking. Dark colored walls and carpet. The bed was comfortable. The tv was nice and big with good channels. Not enough outlets near the bed for charging cell phones.The bathroom was ok. Could use some updating. The toiletries were nice! I really liked the orange scent. There was a coffee machine actually in the bathroom. I never used it. I did use the iron and ironing board though! That came in handy!The hotel served it's main purpose, which was being close to everything! We walked to Union station and on the way back stopped at ""The Dublinger"" and at ""Kelly's Irish Times"" which are decent bars. Nothing fancy. Directly across from the hotel, literally, a couple steps away, is ""The Billy Goat Tavern"" which is a tiny little bar, but it was pretty nice!:) I enjoyed a few drinks there.For dinner we walked 0.6ish miles to Chinatown and had dinner at ""District Chophouse and Brewery"" which was awesome!All in all it was a good stay with an awesome location! The best part was check out. Since we stayed for our anniversary, the same man at the front desk waived the valet parking fee, which was 40 dollars!! (I think) Either way, it was awesome that they didn't charge us!We enjoyed our stay and would come back for the convenience of the hotel. I just think it needs a little updating!"

I herd they had upgraded and I was looking forward to my stay. When I checked in the first shock was the parking fee for my car...$43.00 per day!!! I thought that was outrageous and taking advantage of their guest. But I would have to chock it up, then I checked into my room. The view was beautiful of the Capitol but the room was smaller than I expected for the price which was $199.00 per night. The rooms had some were on it such as mold around the tub and water stain over the bed as if there was a leak that had been fixed but they didn't bother to repaint the ceiling. I decided to cut my trip short and pay the $75.00 early check out fee rather than pay another $142.00 for the room & parking. The whole place seem like they plan to get you for all your money including the restaurant,and the gift shop. The hotel was in a very convient location but definitely NOT worth the money."

For business or pleasure, the central location can't be matched. Walking distance from Union Station, Capital Hill and the National Mall (of museums), you can really get a feel for the city. If you're up for walking, this hotel is perfect. If you're not, well, cabs are rather cheap. To White House ~ $10 To Air and Space Museum ~$10 or less To Lincoln Memorial ~$15 or less. The Quarters: While the design was modern and clearly well maintained, the age of the building shows in the light switches, baseboards, and closet. It's true, there is no safe, but I can't remember the last time I actually used one. The no fridge was more of a bummer. An ice bucket was provided, but I found no information on WHERE the ice machines were located. Furthermore, when calling the Front Desk / Concierge to find out where they hide them, I couldn't get through over a 5min period. No one picked up (approx. 9pm) at either line, after more than ten attempts, I walked downstairs, to find one man working the Front Desk alone. This was on a weekday, when I know this hotel is busy, so where was everyone else?!?The doors are old and heavy, and make a rather loud BANG if not closed lightly. Unfortunately for you, most people won't know this, so every time someone comes home for the night, BANG. Also, the gorgeous Capital Hill views in the images weren't offered. I got the pleasure of staring at the roof of the lobby and the surrounding office. The building is shaped like a big oval, in which I had an inner room. That means, no view whatsoever. Rather disappointing. The employee at the Front Desk was extremely kind and courteous, someone who has clearly worked in Customer Service for a long time. What I hope for in hotels such as this one, are 2~3 OTHER employees with such qualities. I ended up simply buying some drinks from the gift shop, but bring your wallet, because you can't charge items to your room. We actually tried Room Service, which was delivered around that same 9pm time, less than 30min after we placed our order. Amazing service, and a good quality meal, as well. They ad a Service Charge of maybe $4.00, but the waiter only gets $2.00, so don't forget to add a tip on top of that. OVERALL, this experience was great, less the seeming lack of a couple employees. I know times are tough, so maybe it's true they're down a man or woman right now. I should note that there was a rather large convention going on in the hotel, so maybe resources were pulled in that direction. I've rated this hotel Very Good, simply because of the value compared to other hotels in the area. So if your expectations are as such, you will enjoy your stay at this hotel."

We also walked to the Natural History Museum and the National Mall from the hotel, but I would only recommend the latter for those who are in good shape with no physical limitations because this amounted to several miles of walking.The hotel staff was courteous from the onset; the valet option for the car was great because after looking around at other hotels in D.C. I have found that not all hotels have the facilities to ensure a place for your vehicle. The room was clean and looked well maintained, up-to-date, etc. There is a restaurant onsite and room service for those who are interested. There is also a gift shop in the lobby with souvenirs as well as things that travelers might forget (for us it was toothpaste and sunscreen). The prices did not seem higher than anywhere else given that, 1). this was D.C., and 2). a hotel gift shop. I would recommend checking the hotel website for deals and specials. For our visit, I purchased the room online at a discount travel website. For our return visit next month I decided to check out the rack rates and specials on the hotel website and found a really great deal. They have a “Movie Madness” package where upon check-in guests get: free valet parking for the stay (over a $40 value), two IMAX tickets for the Natural History Museum, free internet, $10 on-demand movie credit, popcorn, candy, and coke for the room- for $164 total with taxes. This is by far the best deal that I have found for a hotel around the same area.Therefore, because of the location and price we have decided that this will be our “go to” D.C. hotel. It is very close to the sites and those that are not within walking distance can easily be reached by the metro or taxi."

I had booked through PL and jokingly told the desk clerk "" I'll take the second crappiest room you have."" Little did I know that I would be eating my words.In the hotel's defense, the night was comped and I was moved to a new room the next morning. HOWEVER......the sofabed was truly the worst I have ever slept on; and yes....I have slept on my fair share of them. I know the ""dodge the metal bar"" trick and was prepared to tough it out. After about 4 minutes of trying to find the sweet spot, I gave up and literally slept on the floor. Mattress and blankets etc on the floor for the rest of the night.Moral of the story?.......if you don't have a sense of humor and they try to put you on the sofabed, say NO WAY...it's not worth the aggravation. Betty at the front desk was gracious in my post floor morning crankiness and immediately offered free breakfast; my new room was spacious, clean and perfectly suitable for what I needed.....a decent nights sleep.Would I recommend the hotel ? Sure.....great location etc...just avoid anything other than a real bedMy son and I stayed at this hotel this past weekend and were very impressed with the service...cleanliness and comfort. It was a nice quiet place to end the day. The staff was exceptional and attentive and we had a very pleasant stay. It's located within walking distance to many attractions including the National Mall..the Smithsonian Museums, Capital Hill, the Washington Monument and Union Station.We arrived via rail and after a short walk from union station went to leave our bags with the bellhop since we were 5 hrs early. Front Desk worker was very friendly, asked what we had planned and even gave us our room early. Had a very clean room at the end of the hallway facing the capitol bldg. All amenities were up to par and the $25 property credit per night came in useful for part of the bar tab. Only issue was door slamming at night from other guests which could be heard in the room. Walking distance to national mall and round the corner from postal museum/union station. Will def be on my list of places to stay again if I ever make it back to D.C."

Staff were generally friendly and helpful - special mention must be made of the doorman, who was exceptionally friendly and helpful and not the least bit condescending. The registration staff were, well, reserved and offered no help or information. The first thing I noticed on entering was the smell. The place smelled old and musty - especially in the elevators. The room seemed fine at first glance, although the sheets apparently had not been pressed or ironed and the towels were hanging skew on the rails. The worst was the bathtub, which was infested with black mold along the sides - so badly that I was reluctant even to shower. I had dinner in the hotel also. The menu seemed fine, but the food might as well have been sawdust. My steak was overcooked, even though I asked for a ""medium"" steak. The fries were very good, but the rolls were microwaved and had been in the microwave too long. Breakfast the next morning was equally nondescript and less than appealing. When I checked out, I mentioned the problems with the room, and was made to wait while the receptionist filled out forms and phoned people - so perhaps they have cleaned out the mold by now. Checkout usually takes a few seconds or minutes and is automated in most hotels. Not this one. I had to wait at least 10-15 minutes - and I was the only guest checking out. So - despite a great location, I certainly will not return to this hotel. If they allow bathrooms that are visibly affected, then I have to question overall cleanliness of everything else."

We booked their weekend special and received free parking and a food & beverage discount. The location was great for sightseeing the many attractions of DC. Easy access to the Metro and within walking distance to Union Square. The hotel staff could not have been better to us from the doorman to the front desk. They even upgraded our room to a suite without asking when only a king bed was available for 3 people at the time of booking on the internet. The room was spacious with modern amenities and clean. The bathroom was upgraded with tile and marble although the tub area needed some work. The bed was plush. The TV was a larger flat panel LCD. The carpeting needed cleaning but not worn.

We wanted a place with a great location near our planned attractions (official buildings, the Mall, and museums) and also close to the Metro. This location satisfies both of those quite well. Walking distance to Senate office buildings/Capitol/Supreme Court, where we had plans while we were there; Mall is close by too. And taxis are abundant, and the rates are very reasonable. We wound up using the Metro only once, via Union Station, a short walk away. Very accessible location for getting around by foot. The Capitol area nearby is gorgeous, with parks, flowers, shade trees and benches - very welcoming. I also really wanted a view, and we got it. We booked through Destination DC and got an Executive King for about $260/night, plus tax and fees and all that. I called the hotel directly after I made my reservation, and made my view request clear, and we got a room with a great view of the Capitol building. Although there are three other hotels in very close proximity to this one, The Washington Court is the only one high enough (16 stories) to afford you that view. You will need a room high enough to get it, so ask away AND don't expect the cheapest rooms to get you a view (they will be on the lower floors). I paid a little extra and got what was important to me. Also in D.C., room rates go down as you approach the weekend, so plan your dates accordingly and the rates will even out to a decent rate. The room: Nice, roomy, basic enough, a little ""moderne"" in styling for my tastes but comfortable in every way. King bed, down comforter. There were a few shabby spots -- like the door to the room looks like it has water damage (water?) and the closet rods are beat up. I don't ever expect to see anything looking beat up in a good hotel, so this was a detraction and distraction from any otherwise very good room. SUPER quiet. We rested very well here from our long walks around town!The bathroom, however, was d-e-l-u-x-e. They spent all the extra money in there! It's B-I-G and the shower is even bigger!! Two shower heads, roomy enough for 4 people (I don't suggest that, just giving an idea of size). Nice lighting, plenty of mirrors and shelf space. Really a very special bathroom. Extra points for this.Two closets - again, extra points, even with those beat-up closet rods. Plenty of room for all our stuff.Wound up ordering room service every day, whether for lunch, dinner or breakfast (love that order card that you leave on the door by midnight for service the next morning). Delivery timing was good, but 2 out of 3 breakfasts were missing something that we ordered. Sometimes got a newspaper, sometimes did not. So room service gets an ""uneven"" mark from me. Food quality was very good throughout our stay, however. Breakfast was always good. For lunch/dinner, we sampled delish soup, best buffalo chicken wings we've had in a long time, and the hotel makes excellent burgers.Ate downstairs in the very attractive atrium restaurant once, for lunch. Nouvelle American cuisine, very good food and looked great on the plate. Lots of effort there.Doormen were terrific - we thoroughly enjoyed Sam, who feeds the sparrows by hand, and Tyrone, who loves his cats. Also think I met Justin (on a Wednesday afternoon) who was very helpful and I'm sorry to be unsure of his name. These gents were wonderful; kind and helpful to all, gracious, and they make a great first impression.We were disappointed by neighborhood restaurants. Hyatt for dinner one night - extremely salty food and very expensive, and everything is a la carte. Tried to go to the Dubliner around the corner, but after 15 minutes, no one had come to our table (and they seated us practically on top of other people, on both sides; very uncomfortable) so we got up and left. Went next door to Kelly's Irish Times -- eesh, don't bother. Not for food; it's a bar that also happens to serve food that's not very good. And it was dirty. Ick. You can also head up to Union Station for food, but the atmosphere of a busy train station with the smell of exhaust and a noisy P.A. system shouting all the time just doesn't lend itself to fine dining. Took a cab to Old Ebbitt Grill and had a splendid meal at a reasonable price, so get out of the neighborhood to eat if you don't eat in the hotel itself. This was the only real drawback to the location of this hotel. Sorry to go on and on, but I rely extensively on Tripadvisor reviews when I travel, and feel I owe it to others to give as much detail as possible. We would definitely return to this hotel due to its prime location, the splendid view, comfort of the hotel amenities, and good room service food."

Our room was beautiful and spacious- recently redone. Our room was super clean, and we had absolutely NO problems with our bathroom. We did not have any problems with the elevators. All three were in perfect working order, and we never waited. Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking the courtyard, wonderfully quiet. We didn't hear our neighbors, nor were we bothered with noise from other showers, toilets, etc. We had breakfast and lunch on a few occasions in the hotel. It is not a gourmet restaurant, but the food was fine. Never waited for a cab as the lined up down the street- a blow of the valet whistle and they came running. The business center is small but functional, and offers free printing of your electronic airline tickets and boarding passes. All other internet services require a credit card. The wireless internet in my room cost the standard daily hotel $9.99. This is a wonderful hotel and we will definitely stay here again when we are in town. The ONLY think lacking from this hotel is a pool and hot tub. Also, I was surprised that a hotel of this caliber did not have spa services in the hotel.

Overall, it fit the bill. The hotels were very expensive in D.C. for this weekend, and we were able to secure a room at the Washington Court for just $125 a night on Priceline. The hotel has a lovely lobby and the rooms were very comfortable. I would say that they are showing some wear and tear, but nothing signicant. The bed was comfortable and the room/hotel were quiet. My only complaint is that it took the valet 15-20 minutes to get our rental car - too long, especially when you are paying $30 a day!!! The location is fantastic - just down the street from the Capitol, only blocks from Union Station, and right across the street from a Starbucks! Just around the corner from the hotel is a nice little Irish pub, the Dubliner. I would recommend grabbing dinner and a pint at this place! Overall, I would recommend staying at the Washington Court!I stayed at the Washington Court for a large conference from October 24 - 28. Because of the conference hotel rooms were at a major premium, so I ended up paying around $1200 for a four-night stay. I'm generally a budget traveler, so I was expecting a good experience given the money I was forking out.The hotel is catered to business travelers - I saw few families or children during my stay. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the doormen were very friendly and helpful. The room was reasonably sized but because I got a room facing the street it was noisier than I would have otherwise liked in the evening. The hotel also sits right next to the fire department so light sleepers facing the street will probably get awoken by the blaring sirens every so often. I used earplugs and managed to sleep OK.Room was reasonably appointed and furniture was well-spaced. Bathroom was big and spacious. Major problem was the bed - I thought that it was comfortable until I started getting poked and pricked by the feathers in the mattress and pillows! I was typically so tired each evening that I fell asleep instantly but I woke up a couple of mornings with little nicks and scratches from having rolled around on these sharp feathers. Absolutely ridiculous.Only ate at the restaurant for breakfast - service was mediocre and I ended up ordering the buffet each morning because it took too long to actually be served. Used the fitness area a couple of times (no sauna or hot tub), and the room is small but well-equipped with weights and machines. I have to echo the sentiments of those who have written about the ridiculous practice of being charged for internet access. $10/day for slow wireless internet when I'm paying ~$300/day for the room strikes me as crazy and a pure cash grab.Plus is location - it is around a five minute walk from Union Station where there are plenty of decent restaurants and quick access to the Metro and the rest of the city. It's also close to downtown and if you're not in a rush it is easy to walk to the Convention Center and other centrally-located places. There are a number of nice restaurants in the Capitol Hill area within walking distance.Overall, it would have been a marginal stay had I paid ~$100/night, but for the price I paid there's no way that I would choose this hotel again. Beware!"

Both my son and I loved it. The location is close to Union Station which is great since a lot of the tour busses are picked up there. The front desk was very professional. The hotel lobby was very clean and attractive. The room was very nice and clean as well. The only downside was the bathroom. There was some mold on the walls and paint peeling. Other than that we were very happy with everything we had. Especially thank you to the bartender at the bar that filled our empty 2 liter bottles full of cold water. A tip, don't wander the streets around the area at night.Ok, it isn't The Perfection. The neighborhood isn't wonderful (although near the Amtrak station and the Capitol) and probably it needs a slight renovation, but I can say that overall it's great.The size of the room was normal, but space was well used. The view was nothing special, but some rooms have better views (ie Capitol). The style of the whole hotel is nice mix of modern (not contemporary) and old: the wonderful lobby is the example of modern (50s ?), while the rooms are the example of old with a very nice ""country"" touch (particularly the bathrooms).The personnel is very kind, particularly the guy at the front desk (not remember the name) and all the doormen.Really a great stay and DC is a wonderful city."

Great location! a SaTiSFiEd Vacationer!!!,"We booked a room at this hotel at a 25% discount from expedia.com, and ended up paying $130/night including taxes. The location was fantastic - just one block from Union station, and one block from the Capitol. We were very happy with our room (Deluxe King - the cheapest room with a King bed available), which had a view of the Capitol. The room itself was spacious and clean. The bathroom was very well appointed. Most negative reviews I've read on this site have to do with slow service at check-in or a rude staff member. We didn't face any of those problems. Valet staff was polite - but please be advised that the only parking option is the $30/night valet. No self park. Some negative reviews also concern the restaurant and its limited hours or selection - but if you are in DC as a tourist, you are better off going to one of the great restaurants around the city anyways. Couple of things to note - there is no refrigerator, or safety locker in the room.We found the front desk staff to be a little dull. We had a problem in that one of our rooms was smoky when we walked in (asthmatic family) and it is a non smoking hotel. That was eventually worked out, but the children ended up at the other end of the corridor instead of close by. My FIL had a lovely corner suite with a view of the capital from the living room. There were no problems at all with those rooms, and room service was very attentive when we ordered dinner for 10. The normal person's experience may be different, however.We only had experience with the breakfast (bar) at the restaurant. It was *very* high for what was there, and coffee seemed to be a scarce resource. Our waiter all 3 mornings had to be repeatedly asked for coffee by all who wanted more than the skimpy first cup. The regular room was adequate, with nice linens, but a bit of wear and tear. The bath in one room had a bit of peeling wall paper and a bit of mildew. The HVAC filters had not been changed in a great while, as some of the crud was visible from the outside of the grill.Starbuck's across the street, liquor store with relatively cheap cokes & bottled water on the corner - don't bother with the overpriced store inside the lobby. Great location. Get a good price, or a suite, or it is not worth it."

The only sour note on the whole trip was the unexpected record-breaking freezing temperatures. On Easter morning it was 31 degrees Fahrenheit, about –1 Celsius, with a piercing wet wind all weekend long that made being outdoors very uncomfortable, but we managed to bundle up and enjoy the trip.We stayed in Room 303, a Deluxe room with king size bed, which was very big and comfortable. The bathroom fixtures are beautiful and there’s even a little TV that, strangely enough, doesn’t have the same channels as the big one across from the bed. In fact, it was disappointing to see how few channels the main TV allowed you to tune in, while they offered lots of additional options if you were willing to pay through the nose.The hotel is not big, but the lobby, bar, and restaurant are beautifully built as a flowing continuum with lots of natural light coming in through the glass ceiling. Don’t waste your money on souvenirs at the gift shop; there are many cheaper options two blocks away at Union Station, plus the many souvenir kiosks near every major attraction. Use the bathroom in your room before you check out, because the lobby restrooms require the use of an electronic key card like the one for your room. With the Capitol so near, I guess it’s a security measure, but it was a nuisance.We didn’t eat at the hotel restaurant because we had been warned it’s too expensive. If you are not high maintenance, you’ll enjoy the food court at Union Station, only two blocks away, which provides about 20 different choices, including sushi, pizza, sandwiches, barbeque, wraps, hamburgers, Greek, Indian, Italian, and Chinese. Union Station includes an Amtrak train station and subway station. Besides, the Circulator, Tourmobile, and Old Town Trolley buses to the main attractions in town leave from there anyway, so it made sense to have breakfast or brunch there before heading out. Most of the food outlets there close at 8:00 p.m., so don’t count on a late meal there on your way back to the hotel. If you want to take a guided tour of as many places as possible, take the Tourmobile. We took loved it. It’s $20 per person and you can get the tickets at the desk in the lobby inside Union Station, or wherever in town you are. The blue-and-white accordion style buses are hosted by very friendly and well-informed city guides. We loved the old black guy! You can get off at any of the attractions, spend some time there, and get on the next Tourmobile bus for free by showing your ticket. Repeat the process as many times as you want. Make sure you wake up early so you can make the most of your day and your $20. The buses come every 20 minutes or so, but the last one runs at 5:30 p.m. and there is a lot of beautiful places to see in Washington DC. Use it to see the monuments, not the museums.If you want to take it at the Lincoln Memorial to visit other attractions, do not wait for it at the big bus stop closest to the Lincoln and Korean War Memorial. The one that stops there will take you on a long detour to Arlington Cemetery. Instead, walk up to the humble Tourmobile stop sign almost behind the Lincoln Memorial.If you are going to visit a specific museum, and I strongly recommend the Air and Space Museum, where you must plan to spend up to three hours, It’s a waste to pay $20 for the Tourmobile. Instead, use the Circulator. Their red buses, which are supposed to run every ten minutes but actually come every 15 to 20, only cost one dollar a day and will take you to a stop near or just at the entrance to the most important attractions. They have three lines that overlap and allow you to make a number of combinations using the transfer you must ask for when you get on the first time and pay. You can use that transfer as many times as you want during the same day. However, be aware that the purple line, which covers the National Mall area, stops running at 4:00 p.m. The other two run until 9:00 p.m. and the red line will take you to Chinatown and other lively areas of Washington DC for evening entertainment.If you want to take a guided tour of the Capitol Building you must be at the kiosk southwest of the Capitol extra early, because the tickets fly away like hotcakes. Ditto for the White House. If you want to go to the Old Post Office Tower, arrive one hour early, because the line to go up is very long. If you want to take the subway, ask for help. Their fare system is extremely complicated. Their stations are nice and clean, though very dark inside. There are lots of security officers everywhere, so there’s nothing to fear. Their subway trains are pretty and comfortable.We loved Washington DC and thought it was much more beautiful, cleaner, and safer than New York City. We want to go again in two years, when they reopen the Museum of American History, now closed for repairs. The only thing we disliked was that it is a big modern city with a small village mentality: All the attractions close at 5:00 pm!"

Location is great--walking distance from Union Station, slightly downhill even. Very close to the Capitol, Botanic Garden, etc. We stayed on a Friday night and found the area quiet at our 10pm arrival.The room was really nice! Nicely decorated and upscale with a marble bath and nice amenities. Even a tiny TV in the bath, though we didn't cut it on. The bed was nice and had feather pillows and a feather pillowtop--this is a great idea in theory, however, I had to put on long sleeves for sleeping because I kept getting poked by feathers during the night. Our room had a view of the street and the office building across the way, and the now ubiquitous starbucks on the corner. Check-in was quick and the elevators speedy. Because I reserved through the hotel website, we received a voucher for free breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant. We weren't given this at check-in and remembered later and had no problem getting the voucher from the front desk. Breakfast was nothing to write home about, but it was free and quick.Overall I thought this was a really nice hotel, nice location, and I got a good rate from the hotel's website for downtown DC on short notice. No problems with outside noise and felt safe walking from Union Station with my husband and carrying our luggage at 10pm on Friday night."

Clean enough to walk around barefoot, and although somewhat dated, elegance was definitely the theme. We chose this hotel because of the room rate and convenience to the Mall which was within an easy walk. Not included in the room rate is internet access (app. $10), tax app. ($16 per day) and parking for your car ($30 per 24 hour period, free valet). Breakfast was included and it was in quite a lovely restaurant setting with a superb selection of hot (eggs, sausage, waffles, bacon, French toast, etc) and cold items (cereals, vast selection of fruits, yogurts). Our complimentary breakfast even included gratuities. Service at the restaurant and front desk was exceptional.You can save money by parking on the street late Saturdays and Sundays only for free but be very careful to read the somewhat confusing informational decals on the parking meters with regard to free parking times and days, otherwise, you will get a ticket and/or be towed. We saw quite a few cars being towed, so be extremely cautious where you park.Although the view from our inexpensive room was not the best (the hotel restaurant’s exhaust hood vent) it wasn’t enough to detract from our visit to Washington as we were there to see the Smithsonian Museums and not to stay in our room admiring the views of the city. What was more important was the vicinity to the sights, and the cleanliness of the room, along with an appropriate comfort level. Our first room was # 1416 which had a connecting door to the adjacent room. On our first night, the connected room was vacant and we enjoyed peaceful comfort. On returning to our room after seeing the sights the next day, the adjacent room was occupied by a family with a non-stop crying baby and we could hear throughout our room, the baby’s father whistling to quiet the baby while shaking a baby rattle. We asked for and received a different room, this time without a connecting door. That room was #1612, again with the same view of the roof of the lobby and restaurant vent, just a bit higher. So some words to the wise, be sure to inquire if the room you reserved has a connecting door!All things considered, I would definitely stay at the Washington Court Hotel because it is convenient to the Mall and all museums, the friendliness of the hotel staff and cleanliness of their rooms and vicinity to Union Square where one has a tremendous choice of reasonably priced restaurants and subway. If you like to walk, this hotel is pefectly located to all the Smithsonian Institution sights, White House, Washington Monument, and all other tourist stops on the Mall. What isn't within walking distance is accessible by subway, for example, Arlington Cemetery. For the money, the Washington Court Hotel is an exceptional value."

Positive sides:- The front desk staff was very friendly and professional. A front desk employee recommended we upgrade our room to get a city view and she was right, the change was completely worth it.- The Sofitel is well located and we basically walked everywhere- The room was beautifully decorated - Absolutely loved the shower gel and shampoo smell, amazing- The bed was truly comfortable, we slept like babiesWe wanted to give the maximum grade for our stay, because we really enjoyed our time at the Sofitel, but just wanted to mention little things as areas of improvement:- The mini bar goodies were dusty, which made us feel like it hadn’t been cleaned in a while and didn’t incite us to drink/eat.- One of the coffee capsules was open upon our arrival and not replaced, not sure why it was left there with the new ones. - The breakfast staff could be more friendly, and not add their tip directly on the bill (18%), we like to choose what we’ll give as tips ourselves. All in all, it was a great stay and we’ll definitely be back. We’ve stayed in various Accor Hotels around the world and this one really comes at the top of our list.

Location The hotel is really well located, just a few minutes walking distance from the White House.LobbyIt doesn’t really exist as a lobby as itself, a “passing-through” area that connects the check in area, the bar and the breakfast lounge/restaurant.RoomWe had booked a double room with king size bed. The room was beautifully spacious and comfortable. Spotless carpets, lining and facilities, absolutely noiseless and offering a relaxed and cosy sensation.BedsThe mattress was very good, and the pillows were low but comfortable for us. I can’t remember if there was a pillow menu available as we didn’t need it, the general sleep feeling was excellent.The duvet was comfortable and light, something not really easy to find in a real king size bed. BathroomThe bathroom size is good, spacious for two and spotless and tidy. Bath robes available and average size towels for convenient drying. The bathroom has a classic style in marble.FoodWe dinned out one night and the other at the hotel bar. The atmosphere is nice and there is a feeling of already been there before. The beer selection is good in quality with really nice ales; we had crab cakes and a sort of Caesar salad, both things were delicious and well served. Swimming PoolNo swimming pool in the facility as we know.ConclusionLocation is key in this hotel; the staff is really kind and well trained, making your stay perfect. Congratulations for the quality service achieved to all who work here, and with no doubt this will be our hotel of choice for our next visit to Washington DC.Stayed 4 nights in Presidential Suite at Sofitel while on vacation with family. Hotel suite was very large but very dated. Plus, we had some issues with one of the toilets but nothing major. My family of 5 fit very well in the suite. The location of the hotel was good as we were a short walk or Uber to everywhere we wanted to go. Bonus was a nice ice cream shop just up the road for a nightly treat after mikes if walking. Good value. Clean hotel.Bruna Nelson (Director of Group Sales) is a super star! Assisting with organizing and re-organizing our meeting rooms, fabulous transportation, and expanding room requests for our very fluid business event in WDC. The accommodations were excellent, but it was the professionism of Bruna and her staff that made our event run smoothly despite all the changes. Thank you so much Bruna, the front desk managers, and her transportation wizard, Cynthia Vanzandt. We shall return next year!"

The rooms are perfect; the service is impressive, and the hotel restaurant offers quality cuisine. It might get a little hectic at breakfast time that is out of their control. The people who use our table before we trashed the floor under the table with a massive amount of food that would be visible only when you sit on the chair. The staff took care of it immediately. And here is the secret; however you need to hide it from the hotel staff and management :-) The room prices are excellent. I was expecting to pay at least twice more. Just don't tell them that.How utterly disappointing. We normally love Sofitel hotels yet this one deserves to lose the name. As a luxury travel advisor, this property falls short in the most basic services. Our stay was 3 nights in town for a wedding. I contacted the front desk regarding stains on the curtains, nothing done. I had to look at these stains every time I opened and closed them. Disgusting. The bathroom French doors were broken. One side of the door slammed shut making a horrible noise and we requested it to be repaired. I asked them only not to come when we were getting ready for the wedding. When did they cone? Ye, then. Never repaired. Everyone in our party complained about the tv clicker being extremely difficult to depress the buttons to control tv. I requested that our adult children be near our room in advance of arrival and we ended up on different floors. Not wanting to leave a negative review, I requested numerous front desk staff to have the manager contact me and again at check out. It’s been 4 days and no response."

The Sofitel is located just a few steps away from the White House. My room was available 2 hours prior to check-in. The concierge appeared to greet everyone with a French word or two followed by his/her native tongue. I think the idea was to stay true to the hotel’s French roots. I found it charming. The room was spacious with conveniently located outlets. The room had 2 bathrobes and slippers. The shower was just the right size with a long ledge to easily access my toiletries. The glass shower door kept all the water inside the shower. Lanvin sponsored the toiletries in the hotel room. The gym had personal hand towels and chilled water containing fresh fruit. I requested a refill of tissues for my room and they arrived within 2 minutes. I lost my valet parking tag and the concierge did not make a fuss about it. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Valet parking gives you in and out privileges. Parking here is expensive, $65, and there are not many ways to effectively cut the cost. I will look to book here again on my next visit to DC."

Need to spent time to call the housekeeping and to clarify the status of the occupancy and to request to adapt everything for 3 people : pillows, slippers, towels, in room water, soaps, shampoo...Spacious suite, well and modern equipped with daily cleaning at a proper level.Gym place quite modest and not for 5 star hotel, with a single multi-functional fitness machine broke and also all of the endowment old enough.Opaline, the single place for now where you can take a grab, eat breakfast or dinner appetizers is very cozy but someone need to look at the competition. Differentiation driver should be the wine , otherwise the escargot , tuna , steak , cheese mix, etc, are just as good as nearby restaurants ( Bobby Van’s or Joe’s). I highly reccomend for vegans the vegetables with pink hummus this simple dish surprised me.Modest wine at glass overpriced , lack of half of bottle items, same type of glass regardless of assortment are issues to be solved for the sommelier and not only. Overall a good experience, staff well trained and ready to satisfy customer needs.I stayed at the Sofitel in Washington DC for a night as I was extending a work trip for sightseeing purposes and wanted somewhere comfortable to stay. The hotel (in true Sofitel style and standard) was immaculate with a friendly concierge. I was upgraded to a room with a view due to being a member with hotel points which was very nice and unexpected. The room was also clean and comfortable, with robes and slippers available in the bathroom. The bathroom was also very spacious with a deep tub and a separate shower and great vanity lighting. The location of this hotel is perfect, an 8 minute walk from the White House and all other monuments are within a 20 minute leisure walk. I did not end up eating at the hotel, so I can’t say much about dining but I will add that a Starbucks is conveniently located at the corner of the block from the hotel. I had a lovely short stay here and would definitely return if I’m back in DC again.This was the best hotel I’ve ever booked in DC and one of the most pleasant stays and memorable in last 10years. Super clean, super friendly and best of all the corner room with separate bath and shower was luxurious. Room service was tasty and rapid. Enjoyed the food also twice in the restaurant for breakfast and loved it. Loved the bedding, the natural light in the room and location to metro and walkable attractions. I will book it again later this year."

We traveled from Brooklyn New York. During booking we were asked if we were celebrating anything and the reservationists added bday celebration to our booking. She said they would do something special the day of. We weren’t sure what to expect since we usually book big American chain hotels. We were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome by valet/bellhop/front desk/concierge. We were made to feel very important and welcome to the Sofitel family. Anna Lalain front desk was especially attentive and accommodating during check in and Milan Miklos Koviljac (concierge) was very engaging and knowledgeable about the area restaurants and museums. Milan helped us pick the best place for a bday dinner for casual dress. We plan to bring a dress outfit for our next visit so we can eat atJoe’s across the street. The restaurant staff left a delicious pastry in the room for my daughters birthday and it was decorated and personalized. This may seem small to some but to a child it is important. Everything is in walking distance. CVS - Pizza - Starbucks. We ate at the hotel the first night and breakfast at the Old Ebbitt Grill a few blocks down because we wanted an American style breakfast with omelette/bacon/sausage/ French toast and Sofitel has more of a French cuisine. Dinner the first night was still very good. We left our truck parked in valet for two days and took Uber everywhere. Parking in DC is very difficult. The charge for parking seems very high but it’s standard for most hotels in the area and it’s worth it to have peace of mind. I would stay away from the metro because it’s $2 just for the card then you have to add money to get on the metro. A family of four was $25 round trip to go to The Museum of the Bible. It was $6 by Uber and even less to go to the Martin Luther King Jr. Monument. We must have spent $25 total using Uber for two days going multiple places. The room(suite) we had was very large and for a family of four it was needed. We are a family who loves natural light and there must have been 8 large almost floor to ceiling windows throughout the suite. I think on the next trip (and there will be a next trip) we will opt for a two bedroom suite with a king and two doubles instead of the king and pull out couch. This was an amazing two day trip and Sofitel DC helped in making it special. We can’t wait to visit again. Thank you Sofitel Washington DC. You’ve earned this rating and you are now our #1 place to stay during travel. See you soon!!!

It was spacious and very clean. Nicely decorated. Was very pleased with the room. The bed was a bit too soft and the curtains could not be closed fully. The bathroom was spacious and well designed.Reception: everyone at the reception was friendly and pleased to see a friendly Dutch country fellow lady at the check in desk. For the rest staff was Grounds: didn’t spent much time in the hotel, but the bar had very good and cold beers sBreakfast: this was really odd. I personally prefer a buffet but here you had to choose an option from a set menu. The food was ok though. My comments was the service. Sebastian was very nice but all the waiters had a face like they were working at the graveyard. The service was uninterested and slow. Especially the waiter I encountered twice (taller, slimmer guy) had no manners (pouring coffee only for the male, not female), he could not take simple orders (like a coffee) and showed is disinterest consequently. If breakfast is not in the rate, my recommendation would be to go somewhere nearby where the service is good.Location: very good location! Couldn’t be better. Right next to all the sights and shops and basically at the White House’s backyard.Overall: great location, great room, invisible staff and for sure will skip breakfast next time."

This hotel is absolutely beautiful as soon as you walk in! My husband got a drink at the bar and the bartenders were very professional. The staff is really nice and the hotel is in a prime location! The only downside is that we used valet parking and the hotel charged us $70.00. Please arrange parking arrangements before you come here if you don't want to pay this much for parking. We came on a Saturday and almost every parking lot we came across was either closed or full. We spent almost an hour looking for parking because the traffic was so heavy. I will say that valet parking was well worth it because we kept the car parked or whole stay since everything was either in walking distance and if somewhere was too far to walk, then we would just take the subway. Our hotel room was beautiful and clean but slightly smaller than I expected. I loved the lighting in the bathroom which is a plus when your a woman applying makeup! Lol! Also, the bed was soooo comfortable. If your looking for a nice place to stay, I would definitely recommend the Sofitel!"

Close to the Whitehouse.,"We spent a 4 day weekend in DC. We found a great rate through a internet site and chose this hotel based on location to the sights we wanted to see.It was a bit difficult to find the entrance as there is not a drive thru portico. There is just curb parking for loading and unloading. Once we approached the entrance, the very nice door man showed us where to park and helped us unload the car. We used valet parking $55/day for overnight parking. Most of the garages are $50 but we didn't want to drive all over finding a spot on a week day in a maze of one way streets. Well worth it to use the valet. Anna check us in. She was really nice. I asked if it was possible to have 2 beds instead of the king I had booked. She immediately said she could do that. I asked if that would cost extra since I already had a very low rate. She said normally it would be an extra $50 a night but she would up grade us for no additional charge. The room was very nice. Big TV. Modern decor. Love the large bath sheet towels. All the amenities you expect in an upscale hotel. Bed was very comfortable. The main restaurant was under renovation but all meals could be had in the bar area. We did not take any of our meals here.Tons of places to eat in a 2 block radius. Everything from inexpensive to fine dining. Several Starbucks near by as well as other coffee shops and sandwich shops.This was one block from the White House and easily walking distance to the mall and most of the Smithsonian museums.I would definitely stay here againCheck in was quick, efficient and professional. Room was outstanding and incredibly comfortable especially the bed and pillows.Turn down service added a next level touch especially leaving the radio tuned to a classical station. What a pleasure it was to return to our room!The minor negatives which could be improved on was 1. The attitude of the bell-hops whose offers of help came with the blatant expectation of a gratuity 2. The concierge who is the face of the property should not sprawl over her lectern as the look was not very becoming of such a hotel.All in all, a great and charming hotel if you ignore the small negatives. We will definitely stay here when in the DC area."

Now for the hotel itself...clean, contemporary, nicely appointed rooms with the most comfortable beds and pillows. The bathroom was quite nice. The lighted mirror was wonderful. There was a shower and a separate tub. The toilet was separated from the rest of the bathroom. There is a coffee maker and coffee in the room, however there were only 2 pods of regular coffee. We left a note to have more regular coffee delivered. We received about more pods of decaf so we called room service who promptly delivered 2 pods. We were told to Call housekeeping to have more left during room cleaning. Once again we did not get the coffee. This is the reason that I can not give this establishment 5 stars. We had room service for breakfast and the food was hot and delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel."

With the all inclusive breakfast you had choice of fruit OR egg dishes, and although they made an exception and brought me a small bowl of fruit, a buffet would normally allow a much better selection. They did, however, bake some nice croissants which they went round offering to guests, a nice touch, if not an oddity altogether. So it’s not ideal if you are looking for a varied breakfast. I suppose it’s a small hotel and their restaurant doesn’t have the space for a breakfast spread."

The closet was small but there was ample shelf space and it was sufficient for a few nights. The bathroom was laid out well with a separate tub and shower enclosure. The rainfall shower head provided moderate strength and if I could suggest an improvement, it would be the addition of a handheld unit for a better experience. Two thumbs up for the generous sized towels and the adjustable magnifying mirror.Lots of convenient outlets for charging all the electronics and a well stocked minibar and in room coffee maker provided.

The location is EXCELLENT! It's a stone's throw to the White House and the National Theater, which is where we were going to see the world premiere of Mean Girls, The Musical. The downsides of this hotel are many. First of all, it's an extremely expensive hotel and they tack on a resort fee, which is absolutely ridiculous. ""Resort fee"" in this case seemed to be a way of saying ""we are going to make you pay a lot of extra money for wi-fi access."" Second, the heater in the room didn't work. Then the coffee machine didn't work. When we ordered room service (which was also, surprise surprise, pricey), they only brought one place setting and one glass of water, even though both times I said specifically that we had two people in the room. When I called to tell management of these issues, they were blandly apologetic. There didn't seem to be a lot of sincerity in response to the fact that we were shivering in our room and had to sleep with a sweater and leggings on. There was no offer of complimentary breakfast or any attempt to assuage my annoyance. There was no offer of complimentary coffee since I am currently caffeine-deprived. I guess I could order another pot of their $10 unimpressive coffee, but I feel like I don't want to give this hotel another cent of my money. The room is extremely small and has a very strange rectangular shape. The drapes do not close all the way and they let in quite a bit of light in the morning. The maid removed one of our robes and did not replace it. Another extremely off-putting quirk is that the hotel seems to be doused in the scent of jalapenos. I believe they are going for a scent that resembles something you’d find in nature, but oh my god, I was gagging every time I stepped in the lobby. At least the lobby is pretty. I am beyond disappointed with this hotel and annoyed with its management. I hope other Sofitel properties exhibit the quality that is supposed to be inherent in a five-star hotel. Tres mauvais Sofitel. You need to learn how to appease clients when they have such a terrible experience.Note: After I wrote this review, the management called and comped our breakfast and resort fee. I appreciate this gesture, however I would say that there are still too many downsides of this hotel, especially the “scent pollution.” I hated having to cover my nose whenever I walked in the lobby and rode the elevator. Thankfully, the scent was missing from the hallways. I have no idea why so many high-end hotels insist on piping terrible perfume into the air. Many of the items I have listed seem picky, but when you’re paying top dollar for a supposed five-star hotel, the details are everything. They are selling comfort, service, ambience and convenience. Unfortunately, most of these were not of superior quality at the Sofitel Lafayette Square, Washington DC.More hotel flaws/mistakes:The acoustics are terrible. You can hear every door slam from the other rooms.The maid left her cleaning supplies in the room.Our room service from breakfast was still sitting in the hallway when we returned to the room at 7:30pm. Yikes!"

This hotel was amazing - from the moment we pulled up our car for valet we were helped promptly. Check in took 2 mins and then the doorman helped bring our bags up to the room. The room was very well appointed , the bathroom was beautiful with a tub and shower, the bed was amazing - the best sleep I've had in a hotel hands down. There was absolutely o view from our room we looking in towards another building - but this didn't both us at all. The staff were very helpful - besides a less than stellar visits to the bar to grab two drinks (it took almost 20 mins to get two cocktails and the server actually told us she didn't even start making the drinks because she didn't believe we were old enough to drink until we showed her our ID's - I'm 25 and my boyfriend is 27) but other than that everyone was very helpful answered our questions and have great recommendations. Location is incredible - 2 min walk to the White House and walking distance to all of the landmarks. Loved our visit and I hope to be back !"

The location was excellent and the art deco building was discrete but stylish. I finally had the opportunity to visit and stay here this spring; I was definitely not disappointed.First, regarding the hotel's location. On the northwest corner of H and 15th Streets, Sofitel is barely a block east of Lafayette Park and thus a short walk from the North Portico of the White House. Head further south to the Mall and Washington Monument. And once you get there the Smithsonian Museums are right on your left starting with the National Museum of American History and African American Museum. The World Bank / IMF complex is a few more blocks easy walking distance away to the west. In addition to the in-house restaurant, there are a lot of dining options in the area; for example, Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is just on the other side of H Street.The entrance is on 15th Street, just north of the corner with H Street. The doormen were inscrutable; may they had security on their mind more than hospitality. The front desk staff, however, were generally friendly and ready to offer suggestions on where to go and what to do. The entrance and hallway are of an Art Deco design; upon entry the hotel bar is on the left and ICI Bistro to the right. Reception is at the end of the hallway past the elevator banks. There is traditional lobby; there is a large settee in front of the elevator and 2 small alcoves either side of hallway by the reception desk where you or those waiting for you can sit. The bar, naturally, is a great place to hang out; try to land a table outside when the weather permits.The room was spacious as was the bathroom which featured a full-size bathtub with an adjacent shower stall. There was a decent-sized closet in the entryway as well as a fridge. The flat screen TV was surprisingly large, probable 42-inch or larger. There were a lot of outlets by the head of the bed, not just at the desk, a touch much appreciated. The bed was comfy and I slept well during my 2-night stay. Housekeeping did a good job keeping the room clean.It was nice having Le Bar and ICI Bistro as dining options. Had breakfast and an evening dessert and digestiv at ICI Bistro and the service, while friendly, was deliberate. Maybe it was the French slow-food approach, one that I certainly have no problems with. Fortunately, I was not in a big rush with any of my meals, though I could tell that some fellow diners/guests were getting very impatient. I have reviewed ICI Bistro in the past (May 2014 for March visit). Interestingly I had noted the service to have been ""prompt"" at the time.This an elegant, discrete hotel, very well-located, and definitely worth considering when looking for a place to stay when visiting Washington DC."

Take the Vermont St./White House exit (not 14th St.), walk straight out of the station and walk down I Street, in 1/2 block turn right on 15th. Walk another 1/2 block and on the right, you'll see the French flag - voila, you are there. Pluses: Location for sightseeing, plenty of electrical outlets and USBs in the room (I had a corner ""luxury"" room -- very spacious), and real outlet in the bathroom (not the Shavers Only), quiet room (even on the City View side) with black-out curtains, great customer service, a working thermostat in the room, and the most comfortable bed!, Lanvin toiletries (bar soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion), excellent bar service.Minuses: -- On the weekend, your breakfast/lunch quick service restaurant choices will be limited, i.e., places like Corner Bakery, Au Bon Pain, and any deli/coffee shop in office buildings will be closed on the weekends. There is a Starbucks about 1 block away; we saw 2 others within walking distance that were closed. -- Breakfast at the hotel is order-off-the-menu and is expensive. Example: $25 for a basic breakfast entrée of eggs/bacon/sausage/potatoes/toast/juice/coffee. And coffee is $6 (yummy French press, but still . . . )! I'm surprised a hotel of this quality does not have a coffee maker in the room or coffee in the lobby for guests; geez, even Comfort Inn does that!-- The mini-bar is jammed full, and if you take anything out to put your own drinks in, you'll be charged. (there is an ice-maker on each floor). - The bed is made without a top sheet (European style), so ask in advance if you want it differently. I like this Sofitel, and I would stay here again. Remedy the coffee situation and the mini-bar, and I'd give this place a perfect score."

My wife and I walked to the Sofitel from the Farragut Square Metro Station; the McPherson Station is a shorter walk, but requires a transfer depending on which Metro line you are using. The doormen at the Sofitel were very welcoming as was the gentleman at the front desk who checked us in. Our room was on the eighth floor and had a nice view of the area. The room was spotlessly clean and well appointed. The room had a very comfortable queen sized bed with sufficient seating and closet space. There was a large flat panel television, digital safe, iron and ironing board. The wifi was free and worked very well. We appreciated the nightly turn down service which included drawing the shades and turning on soothing music. The bedding was very comfortable and provided a full night of sleep. The temperature in the room was adjustable, so we were able to adjust the room as the weather changed markedly during our visit.The hotel itself has a somewhat contemporary décor, which extends to the rooms. There are also two dining options on site--Le Bar which serves drinks and a light menu. ICI Urban Bistro serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The prices at Urban Bistro are somewhat expensive; the food was very good and the service outstanding during the breakfasts we had, so the price seemed in keeping with a Washington, D.C. hotel. We were provided complimentary breakfast on our third and final day. This included a choice of meals, selection of fresh baked goods, as well as fresh orange juice, tea or coffee and a carrot juice/apple juice/ginger ""shot.""Checkout was smooth and handled through email. Even my wife's selection of orange juice from our mini bar from the previous night was electronically detected and added to the final balance. We quite enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel and look forward to staying there during future visits to Washington D.C."

The bedroom was lovely, beds are very comfortable and decor more that of a four star hotel. Upon request we did receive a coffee maker. Staff were pleasant but not extremely welcoming. There is no complimentary drink upon arrival such as the Ritz or other luxury hotels would offer. A glass of Joel Gott wine in the bar was $17:10 with tax, a rip of really. The most annoying thing was the fuss made at breakfast time when we had no ""vouchers""...we had not been advised we needed to produce any vouchers (nor were we given any upon arrival). Turns out if you are on a B&B rate you get a limited breakfast menu. It is still a very good breakfast, but strikes me unfair to differentiate for a rate of $450! If the Sofitel truly wants to be a luxury hotel it would be nice if they redo the bedroom hallways, offered a glass of champagne on arrival (it is a French hotel!), did not differentiate patrons at breakfast time and were more warm & welcoming."

Superb.Sofitel had bistro/ small bar too - try prawn coconut entre- we tried breakfast at Sofitel and it was just average - but handy when you want to start brekky early (try and explore the restaurant and cafes maybe 5 blocks from all directions and you will find and discover one for yourself (Potbelly, DC tacos to name few cheap eats) Walgreens and Starbucks are not far from hotel.I recommend Sofitel for comfy stay at DC, warm people, reasonably priced hotel in the area (Willard hotel is nice too but more pricey)Suggested attraction: Air and Space Museum (try the flight simulator $8 per ride - kids and kids alike will surely enjoy this) Enjoy DCPhotos: mostly from Air and space museum; White House and prawn coconut from Sofitel bistro"

The Sofitel is a trendy hotel that is situated very centrally for tourists. We were able to do a great deal of sightseeing and liked the idea of walking to a number of the different attractions. When we checked in we explained that we would be celebrating our anniversary and I had called ahead to let them know. We were given a very small room that literally looked at a wall (see image of our view attached) . I wasted no time in pressing zero and requesting a different room. I was told that because it was our anniversary they would be willing to give use a larger room and someone would be up shortly with a room key. We literally sat there and waited for an hour (because I guess we are too polite for our own good) Finally my desire to make our dinner reservation on time got the best of me and I called reception again, they seemed to have forgotten about us and we were told once again that someone would be up shortly with a room key. About ten minutes later there was a knock on the door and we were granted a key to an ""upgrade""I have to admit the view was better (see images below) and the room was slightly larger because you had to turn the corner for the rest room. They were also nice enough to leave a selection of cakes with happy anniversary which was wonderful. It would have been better if they could have done that to start with and a complaint and an hour long wait had not been necessary. Overall nice hotel with small rooms, mediocre service that is centrally located. I would stay here for business but definitely not for a romantic getaway."

Very comfortable bed, pillows, beautiful bathroom with tasteful shower enclosure as well as bath, and loads of toiletries. Terrific staff. So what caused me to withhold that 5th star? The internet was not great, dropping out a lot, and the air con never went as low as advertised. It was cool, but that missing chill that you might want was missing and the duvet got too warm at about 3 a.m. And the parking was expensive. In fact almost double what I (apparently mistakenly) assumed the price was. But once you are there it is too late to argue. Annoying!We went to DC/Sofitel for my husbands 35th birthday. The hotel did everything to make it a special birthday. They sent him macrons, gave him free dessert at the restaurant and made sure we had everything we needed in our room to make us feel great! The room/bathroom were lovely. Lanvin shower products, great bed-sheet (which I needed up buying on their shopping site), great mini bar, plus awesome view of the city."

I shared a room with a relative and we were expecting a high quality luxury hotel but this hotel fell well below expectations.Behind the stylish facade our room was average. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have slept in. The sheets were mediocre and one even had a three inch tear in the middle. The pillows were lumpy and horrid. The hotel uses a synthetic underlay under the bed sheet which was so hot that I removed it after the first night. But underneath the synthetic underlay there was an additional feather underlay which was so prickly that I felt like I was sleeping on a bed of pins. The room’s windows didn’t open which meant the room was stuffy and hot. It was 10 degrees outside (50 degrees Fahrenheit) and we still needed to turn on the air conditioner.The room’s desk and chair looked fashionable, but were impractical for doing work on a laptop. The chair had a high arched back and when I lifted my arms it felt like I was wearing a straight jacked.The bathroom was nicely appointed although it had poorly designed stubborn double doors which kept swinging shut and made it difficult to enter and exit the bathroom.The mini-bar fridge was overstocked and it was not possible to store any personal items in the fridge without removing items (which then set off sensors in the fridge that automatically charged items to the room – a policy which doesn’t put the guest first). Many hotels (including basic and luxury hotels) provide guests with a fridge to store personal items.Curtains in the room were ineffective for blocking out light. There was limited space to store luggage, clothes, and personal items. Our room didn’t contain tea or coffee making facilities which is surprising given that a kettle is standard in hotels around the world regardless of price. In terms of service, there were several poor incidents which were below what I would expect from a hotel at this price. Firstly, the reading light above one of the beds was broken so we called reception to have it fixed. We were told someone would be up to fix this. But after two hours no one had come to fix it and this was never followed up or fixed by the time we left two days later.Secondly, when I checked in online it stated that I would be emailed a copy of the invoice after departure. When I checked out I again confirmed with the receptionist that I would receive my invoice via email. After one week I still hadn’t received the invoice so I emailed the hotel. I didn’t receive a reply so I reforwarded my email. I then received a prompt reply, but the fact that it took two weeks and two emails just to get an invoice, which should have been sent automatically, is very poor.Thirdly, the hotel needs to look at how they process credit card authorisations. When I checked into the hotel I was asked to provide a credit card for an authorisation. By the time I had left the hotel there were four charges sitting in authorisation from the Sofitel totalling over $1000. I have no idea what these three additional authorisations were for as the only time I presented my card to any hotel staff was during check in. It appears that this hotel places authorisations on credit cards willy-nilly.The bar was average. Take away the high end drinks and it could have been an old grubby Victorian pub rather than a luxury hotel bar. The furniture was old and in poor conditions. The chairs were very uncomfortable. Tables hadn’t been cleared and there were crumbs and food on the floor and chairs.As a platinum Le Club member, the benefits were fairly meagre. There was no room upgrade and late check out was until 3pm only.Connecting to WIFI was unnecessarily cumbersome and we needed to re-connect every 24 hours. This hotel should offer one login which lasts for the duration of the stay.In terms of value, this is one of the most overpriced hotels I have ever stayed. We paid about $1000 for our three night stay. We actually had eight nights in total in Washington. For the additional five nights we booked a different hotel. Had we booked these extra 5 nights at the Sofitel the price increased to between $500-700 a night (and that was booking in advance). These prices bare absolutely no resemblance to the quality of the accommodation. I would not recommend this hotel."

We travelled with our two pugs and chose this hotel as our base as they offered to let pets stay free. We couldn't have asked for a better or more central location as it's just steps away from the White House. Our corner room 835 was Superior King and it was spacious with lots of natural light. It didn't have a city view but was very quiet. The bedding was oh so heavenly! A few side notes:Valet parking is pricy (about $62/night) and the loading/unloading area in front of the hotel is extremely small. It was quite stressful when we checked in as taxis and other cars were all waiting to do the same thing, and fighting space with the street traffic. To pick up our car it took about 15 minutes when we checked out.Everything at the minibar had a weight sensor. The in-room complimentary water could be found on a nightstand. It was a very hot weekend when we travelled so the concierge also offered us water bottles for our day excursion. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Sofitel Washington DC. All the staff were super friendly to our fur babies too."

Room and bathroom were well appointed, robes, slippers, lounge chair, desk. Would definitely consider again.My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend for his birthday and from the time we walked in to the time that we walked out the stay was wonderful. The room was very large. The bed was amazing (we actually looked at how to buy the bed and everything that comes with it.) The bathroom was large and had a lot of room for both of us to get ready in. I loved the two doors that shut and not just a regular door. The staff in the bar were very nice and the drinks were strong, but very tasty. The gym was also very nice and had a lot of different equipment. Breakfast was very good also! Pricey, but nice. A warning about room service, while it is nice to not have to leave your room the price is $$$$. Other than that it was quick! We were looking to go to dinner in Chinatown and the concierge recommend a place to eat and it wasn't too bad. They were all very nice and would always say hello and ask us how our stay was going and if we needed anything at all. I think that they were surprised that we would pretty much just walk everywhere or just take the subway. The view we had was of the side streets and very quiet.

Overall, the friendliness of the hotel staff everywhere was excellent, all smiles, politeness, and friendliness. The house keeping was probably the best we have ever encountered in our many travels; we didn't have to wait for our room to be cleaned on time, A+.The location of the hotel can't be beat, it is equidistant from all major DC points and attractions, right next to the White House, and within a very short distance to a host of the best DC restaurants.The room (3026) was great, a corner room with four windows. The room was greatly and meticulously appointed, the number of outlets and USB ports was more than adequate and their location had a user comfort and convenience in mind. The design is modern, creative and evocative of both DC and Paris (Sofitel is a French chain with its HQ in Strasbourg). The number of elevators is sufficient, you don't have to wait for it, for one of the hotel's three elevators is always at your disposal. Our room featured a separate small lobby with a huge closet and a minibar. The bathroom, almost entirely separated from the room itself, was very spacious, had both a shower stall and a bathtub; the toiletries by Lanvin were of a very high quality. The only shortcoming that the Management has to work on is the extremely poor WiFi. We had it for free as our upgrade option, but most of the time we had to switch to 4G so bad the connection was.Other than the WiFi, and the surprising absence of a coffeemaker, excellent hotel, excellent staff, great comfort and the most envious location. For Ici bistro, please refer to our dedicated review of the establishment. Highly recommended."

We couldn't have been more delighted! The hotel is on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House and Mall, with all the convenience that location gives. The staff was friendly, helpful, and efficient.  The room was sumptuous! Lush bedding, comfortable bed, modern bath with shower and bath. Spacious. We spent a lot of time in a different downtown hotel- one with history and class- and our room was nicer, roomier, and $200 a night less.  I asked for a room up high; I hoped for a view of some kind. I got a view of the rooms on the other wing of the hotel. It's built like a squared off ""C"". So much better views would be had from the south side of the southern wing or north side of the northern wing. I wonder it the rooms at the top on the west end of the most southern rooms can see the White House-- it's only 2-3 blocks away. But the window we had had nice light. There was a clever privacy screen for it, and ,like I said, the room was sumptuous."

If this is important for you too, then you are here at the right place. Two of the Metro mainstations are close (i.e.Mc Pherson Square), main attractions of Washington are in walking distance, many shopping opportunities two blocks away (F Street) and in the neighborhood are many fine (and expensive) restaurants. We were as tourists here for 4 nights and our main criteria was fully satisfied.The hotel itself has an excellent quality. Our Superior room was large and fine prepared every day, had a very comfortable Kingsize bed and a bathroom with spacious shower. All you can expect from a 5-star hotel is here; free WLAN included.The service was friendly, discrete and attentive. Very pleasant.All this has its price. We were surprised to recognize how much it depends on the weekday. Tuesday and Wednesday were more than double of Friday. I do not know, if this is in every week the case. But if you are flexible in the dates, it can be useful to compare which part of the week is best in price."

It's around the corner from the Mcpherson Square stop. We took the metro the night of arrival to reach the hotel and had trouble locating the hotel in the dark. But in the daytime it was very easy to locate. This hotel is situated in a business district so the restaurants nearby close around 7 pm. My favorite aspect of this hotel is that it is a very short walking distance form the White House. The room was modern and clean. The only con was that the mini fridge is full to capacity with various alcoholic drinks so I was not able to store my milk in the fridge. So if you're looking for a hotel with a fridge with enough room to store insulin, formula, or special dietary food then you should look elsewhere or maybe talk to the hotel management to ask if they can remove items in the fridge to make space for your supplies. All the employees including concierge, housekeeping, and front desk were friendly and helpful except the doorman. The doorman saw us leaving with luggage and he did not open the door for us and he was not helping others. We have stayed in various luxury 4 star hotels and I think the doormen are usually the ones that either make or break the impression since they interact with you when coming and going. The doormen at this hotel acted like they didn't care for the most part."

I loved the location of this hotel, close enough to walk to many of the historical landmarks Washington DC has to offer. The hotel was very clean, beds comfortable and bathroom was a good size. I booked a room with a city view and was a little disappointed my view was the building next door. When I called down to the front desk, they told me I'm not in NYC where you can get great views and in Washington DC, this is all you can get for a city view. Maybe if I knew that, I wouldn't have paid the extra 700 hundred dollars for my four night stay."

Upon checking in, our TV was not working properly it was fix fairly quickly. We had a corner king room with ok views on one side and not so good on the other. We usually stay at the Willard while in DCthey were completely booked so we ended up at the Sofitel. It is a lovely hotel and very comfortable. Bathrooms were extremely clean and well equipped. Separate tub and shower. We do like the location of the Willard over the Sofitel. Sofitel is more in the downtown district very close to the front of the White House and walking in early evening is nice lots of restaurants. This location is further from the mall and museums.So the only reason I would choose another hotel over the Sofitel would be location, although it is still very well located. The lobby is also not all that big, looks a lot like a little boutique hotel when you first walk in. Make sure if you have a car you let the hotel know. We had a difficult time parking our car just so we could get checked in and let them valet the car.We also ordered room service in the AM. The coffee was French Press very nice and yummy Eggs benedict done perfect, although they forgot to give us silverware so we ate with our coffee spoons.. No big deal. but your are spending 540.00 a night for a room, so you expect pretty close to perfect.. I really would love to give this place a five star they really are not that far off.Just a few things as mentioned above held me back"

The room was very, very large and well designed. The bed was comfortable with quality linens and pillows. The bathroom was also huge with a separate soaking tub and shower stall. The desk area was nicely separated from the sleeping area. Wifi was free and worked well on multiple devices. Housekeeping did an excellent job servicing the room each day. It was always spotless upon my return. The free coffee in the lobby bar every day was a nice, appreciated touch. I had two meals at the French bistro in the lobby and they were both excellent. Room service was a also well above average in terms of quality of the food and timelines of delivery. The staff, especially the doormen, were helpful and friendly. The location is perfect for anything in the DC metro area with access to multiple subway lines nearby. I had no trouble getting to Northern Virginia or Maryland from the Sofitel. The only suggestion for improvement relates to the heating system in the room. It was an incredibly cold week and even with the thermostat on the maximum temperature, the room remained chilly. There is a minibar and a full sized hair dryer is provided in the bathroom."

Front desk staff were all great, especially Emily who graciously accommodated our request for a quieter room (our first room was on the second floor directly over the front entrance, and early morning conversations on the sidewalk woke my husband). We were moved to a larger room several floors higher - I believe it was an upgrade from a superior to a deluxe room? The property is attractive, the rooms well-appointed with an iron & ironing board, a comfortable bed, blackout curtains, good bedside lighting and adequate electrical outlets. Free wi-fi was relatively easy to access and fast. However, it didn’t quite rate 5 stars due to a number of little things, and more significantly the poor service in the very overpriced restaurant.What could be improved? The water pressure in the shower was very low, but I suspect this is a citywide issue, as we found public drinking fountains unusable for the same reason. More drawer space (only 2 tiny ones) and more hangers (which were provided on request) would be nice. The bath towels are rather small and cheap. The bed had no top sheet, only a duvet inside a cover, which does not provide much flexibility temperature-wise. More consistent attention to housekeeping issues is needed – the safe was broken in our first room, there were no hand towels in our second room, bathroom amenities are not replenished, and we never received turn-down service during our 4-night stay (I didn’t even know they had it, until I read other reviews noting it was inconsistently provided). A bit more on the restaurant...hard to believe this is run by the same business that provides such excellent service at the front desk and concierge desk. We had drinks on the patio twice, and breakfast once, and each time found the service pleasant but slow. At breakfast, there was no hostess in evidence, so people were standing around looking to be seated and the wait staff were seating guests. The couple at the next table, seated later, received their order before us. In the bar, two sambucas and a coffee with Bailey's came to $44 plus tip. Iced teas arrived in smallish glasses with a single ice cube each...on a very hot day. We asked for more ice, and also had to ask for sweetener as none was brought or offered. And no refills were offered either, despite the $5.50 price tag (each). We gave up on the bar & restaurant after that, and walked a block to Starbucks or further up 14th for breakfast.Overall, we were happy with the Sofitel and would stay here again, particularly as the location was so good. But it was not so fabulous that I wouldn't consider alternatives."

From the moment we checked in, everyone at the Sofitel treated us like royalty. The bellmen and valets unloaded our bags, put them in our room, and took custody of our car without needing any direction. As we checked in to the elegant lobby, the bellmen gave us a tour of the amenities. During our stay, we returned several times each to the hotel bar and the separate restaurant. They were both very romantic, with candlelit tables and fine French service. Every meal at the hotel restaurant was amazing! Their cuisine embodied a casual French sensibility that treated the guest to some very rich flavors without any of the traditional pretense common to French restaurants. Throughout the hotel, we found that any request we had was promptly fulfilled with a classy, French-accented enthusiasm. This made for a very special experience that my girlfriend and I truly enjoyed. Also, the hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the White House and all the attractions on the National Mall. Even taxi rides to historic Georgetown were only about $10.

We'd been nervous that we might come face to face with that indifferent attitude and service the French can sometimes display. Not a bit of it. Everyone from check in to departure, efficient and friendly and attitude free. You can pay more for a room in DC but you won't find anywhere more welcoming or as well located.

Aircon, shower, bath all efficient and powerful. Staff exceptionally friendly and polite. Concierge extremely knowledgeable. Check in / Check out desk speedy , well staffed and efficient ( Why, oh why, can't other hotels get this right ? ). Restaurant takes orders until eleven at night - great for those taking the red eye in from LAX. A reasonably priced wine list that will bring a smile to your face.Cons - Small but important point. Don't try to have anyone contact you through the hotel switchboard. Multiple friends calling gave up after five minutes. Even worse out of hours. Seems to be no night coverage of the switchboard.Conclusion. Perfect place for a DC vacation or for business at that end of town. Comfortable, stylish and affordable. Great food.

It says that room (luxury, king size) wich we've booked has a terrase/balcony. No rooms at this hotel seems to have a terrase/balcony.

Its great location makes it easy to walk to some of the major points of interest in the capital, and the hotel staff are always very helpful and pleasant. We stayed in a Luxury King on this 3-day visit; the room was spacious and well appointed, the bathroom large and spotlessly clean. The room was on the 4th floor and looked out over the front of the hotel on to the junction of 15th and H Streets; there was no external noise, and the sleep quality was great. It's good to be able to get a complimentary coffee or tea from the bar area in the morning. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (but did have dinner there one evening). For breakfast, there are several places close by; for example, turn left out of the hotel, cross the road and you have a Starbucks and a Pret a Manger within a couple of hundred yards. While I prefer to seek out independent hotels when visiting places here and abroad, I usually opt for Sofitel in D.C. and New York as they are central and have always proved reliable.Sofitel is a great property with a nice bar area and extra amenities. For example, it rained every day I stayed there and the doormen would walk me around with their umbrellas and call taxis for me. The room would have been perfect for a 1 or 2 night stay or if I had been traveling alone. It seems this property is designed for the solo business traveler who lives out of the suitcase. However, in my case, there were two of us traveling together and staying for almost a week - and it was difficult to unpack making it hard to just relax there. The closet was so small we could only hang up 2 days worth of clothes. They also did not provide enough hangers, and we had to call to request more. When they brought more hangers, one of them was broken and unusable. And, there were only 2 small drawers in the entire room - not even large enough to contain socks and undies much less a pair or two of jeans or a sweater. The bathroom was fairly large with a shower and bath separated which is nice. Two robes and slippers were provided which was lovely. There was only 1 sink. I had read a review before visiting that stated they had L'Occitane products. This was not the case when I was there - there were no L'Occitane products in my room. Also, they do not refresh or replace the products. So, by the 2nd day we ran out of shampoo and by the 3rd day we ran out of conditioner and it was never replaced. They also did not provide any products for the bathtub other than soap. The room is very large but I didn't care for the fact that the bed was right by the door meaning you can hear the activity in the hallway, the elevator dinging, etc. I found the bed to be very comfortable. Also, there are lots of outlets everywhere so it was very easy for us to charge all of our devices while we stayed there. There was one hiccup when we checked in - we were given our room number (931) and took our bags up to the room. But, when we got there there was a ""maintenance tag"" on the door and the door was open. We cautiously went inside, there was no one there, and called the front desk to inquire whether we should stay there or move. They said to stay there and they would get back to us with whether we should change rooms. We waited over an hour before they got back to us and then they said we should stay there. So we started unpacking. Right about the time we finished unpacking, maybe 20 minutes later (so about an hour and a half after we arrived at the hotel), we got another call asking if we wanted to change rooms. We said we had already unpacked, so they offered to send a fruit plate to our room at no charge. The fruit plate arrived 1.5 hours later and was very uninspired (see photo). Obviously we could not really complain since it was free, but it was just another annoyance when checking in that everything was seeming to go wrong. One final note: Everyone speaks with a french accent in this hotel, and I speak a little bit of French myself, but it became frustrating when they appear not to understand simple English such as ""taxi"" or ""clean the room please"" or ""why is there a maintenance tag on our door."" Overall, while this is a very nice hotel, I did not have an enjoyable experience and I would not stay there again unless it was only for 1 or 2 nights by myself."

Location was excellent, as we were in D.C. to watch Cher concert and wanted to stay in a place close to main tourist attractions and the Verizon Center (where the concert took place). Metro station is just 1 ½ block away. We arrived on Thursday morning (around 08:30 am) and all we wanted was a room after a long flight from Rio. Surprisingly, we didn´t even have to ask for an early check-in. The front desk receptionist was happy to inform that our room was already ready for us!! By the way, the whole staff of the hotel was very, very friendly and helpful during our stay. Room was very spacious, with a very comfortable king size bed. Bathroom was very spacious as well. The only downsizes were that one day they forgot to clean the room (we didn´t have fresh towel nor soap the next morning) and the free internet wifi is very slow sometimes. Overall, these small downsizes did not spoil our excellent stay and I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel. I will definitely stay there on my next trip to D.C."

The only issue is the lack of good bars and eating spots near the hotel. There are a few steak houses close by, but I felt like we were in the business district at night over the weekend, since not much seemed to be open around us and was very quiet on the weekend. We went to Georgetown one night and felt that, that had more dining options and a more night-time vibe.Room: Room was a good size and the bathroom was spacious. No complaints. Our view was of a brick wall, but we were not in the room too much so that did not bother us.Dining: we ate at the bar a couple of nights and the service was slow. Food was good with a nice selection, shame it took a while to place orders for drinks and food. As for the restaurant we only ate Breakfast there twice and both times the food and service were very good. The bread basket and fruit were fantastic.Overall the hotel is in a good location and the service throughout the hotel was friendly and consistent."

She confirmed all the details as booked and took time to explain the hotel facilities. First impression - the reception area, the bar, the business centre and the concierge desk are all very small which surprised me – it’s a large hotel with I think around 15 floors of rooms but the public area is very small indeed – although beautifully furnished and glossy.The room (5th floor) overlooked the street below which is one block from the White House. It had a comfortable king sized bed, large work desk and ergonomic chair plus one other small table and armchair (it really needed another armchair) The bathroom was standard Sofitel – clean and well stocked although no orchid and no candle like some others. Hotels of this standard usually offer 3 large bath towels but we had two large towels plus two robes and slippers. Toiletries are the standard Lanvin range (quite highly scented so take your own if you’ve got sensitive skin). Housekeeping was good but we returned with some bags one day and the room still wasn’t cleaned by around 3.30pm - which I think is too late.The TV was large and had lots of channels although the picture quality wasn’t good but we only needed it to catch up on the weather so not a big problem. Wi-fi wasn’t included in the room rate but it was offered free at check in thanks to our A-Club loyalty card. Wi-fi speeds weren’t bad but they weren’t superfast either – if you were using it for work you may struggle.I can see that others have mentioned the breakfast offering and indeed this was the worst aspect of the stay. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel simply as it was the most convenient option. In truth this was a mistake. The seating is limited (maybe 20 tables at most which means you have to wait at busy times) and the service is painfully slow and erratic. It took an age to get served, a long time for the food to arrive and even longer to get another drink. On the first day we each had a bowl of fruit, eggs benedict (potatoes were cold) and a coffee and orange juice. The bill, which had service already added (“for your convenience”), came to $85 ($15 for the eggs, £7 for the coffee, $6 for the juice etc etc) Definitely not worth it. We tried again on the 3rd morning of our stay as it was raining outside and we didn’t want to wander around finding somewhere to eat but the waiting time was even longer and the American breakfast was disappointing – the scrambled eggs were horrible. I think it’s best to do some research before you go and find nearby alternatives. The restaurant really lets the place down.Check out was a breeze and the bill was correct. Overall it’s a solid Sofitel and if you can get a good rate the central location (McPherson metro stop is a short walk away) is really convenient. Just look elsewhere to eat!One more thing - although tea and coffee are available in the bar each morning it is INCONVENIENT for your guests to have to go and get it! Its time to put tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms and join the 21st century...."

A short hop by taxi from most attractions in Washington and near many good restaurants.This is a luxury hotel ideally located so you can expect to pay a lot but if you can afford the cost it is well worth it.The bedroom was large with an attractive modern decor with large comfortable king size bed. Accor pride themselves on their superb bed specification. The bedroom was well lit from lamps and naturally with windows along the long wall and the bed facing out towards the windows. There was good blackout with the curtains. A slight noise was audible from the road but this was not enough to disturb sleep. The hall leading to the bathroom was on the opposite side to the entry door which meant you had a comfortable area for dressing next to a large wardrobe. A nice touch in our room was a small recess suitable for the suitcase to be placed on a rack.The bathroom was four piece with separate shower to the bath. It felt spacious and luxurious. The was great attention to detail such as the two reading lamps above the bed in addition to the bedside lamps. The rooms are quiet apart from the major fault that the bedroom doors do not have anti slam or cushioning resulting in heavy and load closure of adjacent guestroom doors. Did not cause any problem when we wanted to sleep.Service at reception was quick and polite even when under the stress of a large number of people waiting at the reception desk. There were always two or three receptionists. The concierge were so helpful giving sound advice and assistance in booking where to eat locally.The lounge and bar was sometimes very busy, noisy and crowded due to functions but at other times it was a pleasant place to relax after a hard day. The furniture did however showsigns of wear and need of replacement. OK for a normal hotel but not in a 5 star hotel. The staff service were mixed in the bar with some good service and some mediocre especially when we arrived at the end of a long day in Washington to ask if tea was being served. We were not amused when we were asked if it was for take away with a little condescending edge until we confirmed we were guests at the hotel. Should not happen.The breakfasts were a delight with excellent service and ""alors"" if you ask you can find full fat yoghurt in an american hotel. The Indian waiter was particularly good. Beware breakfast is expensive and extra to the room cost but it certainly sets up the day well.This stately and expensive hotel is superbly situated, with the White House just around the corner, a metro station close by and also at an acceptable distance from the (National) Mall with its splendid memorials and great museums. It is a fifteen minutes walk to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The first of my 5 nights stay in the hotel was in a Superior room. However, these rooms are on the backside and offer no street view but overlook a rather dark inner courtyard. This is not a problem when you have booked for one night but may be a depressing idea when you stay longer. The next day a kind lady at the reception helped me to find another room (Luxury room) and this was perfect. The rooms are large and meticulously clean, the bed and the bathroom are perfect. What I missed was the possibility to make a cup of coffee or tea. Considering the substantial size of the hotel the breakfast room is relatively small. This brings me to the only minor negative aspect of the hotel, but this is a very personal opinion. Breakfast can only be ordered, with prices reflecting the size of the hotel, while I prefer a buffet breakfast. Considering the hotel price, it also would not seem illogical that breakfast is included, but this may be a naive idea. Fortunately, at the other side of the street and opposite the main entrance of the hotel, is a Devon & Blakely, with a large choice of coffees, sandwiches, croissants, cakes, salads and soups. This is a fine address for (generally take-away) breakfast and lunch. Certainly I was not the only Sofitel guest who preferred to have breakfast here.My husband and I stayed five nights in this beautiful hotel on the corner of H St. and 15th in Room 916, overlooking 15th, Bobby Vann's Steak House, and a business building (king room). Rooms on the southern end of the hotel facing east would overlook Lafayette Park and the White House...next time we might request that. From the ninth floor traffic noise was audible, but muffled; did not bother us at all. Arriving by taxi, there is a small inset (two car space) in busy 15th St. to unload your luggage, also a few spaces usually available on the street where you could pull a car in long enough to unload. Parking however is valet only, $52/night. We rented a car for two days from Enterprise on Vermont St,. a three short block's walk west, to tour Annapolis and Mt. Vernon, and the rental and valet parking all worked out conveniently. The bellmen were courteous and efficient, not pushy.The exterior of the building is attractive with inviting outdoor seating and international flags (it's a French chain). Plush, smallish lobby with smooth check-in from pleasant, professional staff.Our room was lovely, just as in reviewers' photos, with safe, mini bar, robes & slippers, comfortable, plush bed, maybe a bit soft. Maids were unobtrusive and quiet. Only complaint was our towels were not replaced for three days, probably because we re-fold them to keep things looking neat, but still it was obvious they were used. The beds do not have a top sheet, so we left housekeeping a note requesting one, which was done. Greatly appreciated.We had room service one night, hamburgers and soup. It was nicely served; food was okay. Tea and coffee are complimentary every morning in the posh bar, but no food at all. There is the White House Deli immediately across the street with good pastry and breakfast burritos, but on weekday mornings only. Starbucks and Cosi and others are within two block's walk. The hotel restaurant is open for a lovely, but expensive breakfast. For dining, we ate at Siroc, and Ceiba and Old Ebbitt Grill. All were in close walking distance with excellent food and ambience; the Old Ebbitt was our favorite. You will pay over $100/couple at all three for dinner, but it was worth it. We walked past the Occidental Grill near the Willard Hotel, looked very nice, so we'll try it next visit. Did not eat at the hotel restaurant...looked sleek and elegant, but the contemporary decor and the menu just didn't invite us.We loved being two blocks from the White House. Walked over there several times, saw the presidential motorcade leaving twice, with all the resultant security. It's quite impressive. Plus we walked all over downtown, the mall, the museums. The hotel area feels very safe with many business people, tourists, joggers, etc. at all hours. However, there are MANY homeless who overtake the lovely little parks every evening (the smell of urine is quite strong) and were crowded into the doorway of an abandoned shoe store two blocks away on 14th St. They did not approach anyone that we saw, but it puts a definite negative undertone to being downtown.Oh, the WiFi and flat screen tv worked great in the room. The staff were lovely; several spoke French. This is a very well-managed hotel and we will be back!"

Everything was excellent. The staff members were all very polite and helpful. Great attitudes and genuine friendliness. They even come by your room at night and ask if you want a free Evian water or turndown service. Unexpected, but very nice!The room (mine was a superior king room) was a decent size and had plenty of space. Bed was comfortable and the amenities (flat screen tv, Bose radio with iPhone dock, modern decor) were more than satisfactory. Only small negatives (not big deals) were: no fridge except for the minibar with items for sale, no in-room coffee, desk chair wasn't particularly comfortable.The bathroom was especially nice. Bathtub and a separate shower with rain showerhead. Great selection of soaps. Since I had to do work, I used their basic free Internet. It was adequate speed and I was able to do my work -- including Remote Desktop -- without a problem. Gym: I found it to be fine. Had multiple pieces of cardio equipment, free weights, and some weight machines. Filtered water and towels provided. But, no real locker room and less equipment than some larger chain hotels. For me, no big deal.They had free coffee and tea in the bar area in the morning. Coffee was good. Overall: Loved this hotel. Great choice for DC area. Easy to access from metro too (McPherson Sq).

Not just in terms of tourist attractions, but also local reasonably priced eateries and shops. Five Guys is about 200 yards from the entrance and every morning we had breakfast in the nearby Corner bakery café which was superb value for money.- Very nice/spacious (corner) room. Lots of large windows made it very bright (but blackout curtains were very effective).- Large and very pleasant bathroom area.- We were only on the third floor, but were never disturbed by street noise outside. It also seemed a quiet hotel (only once in a week were we disturbed by a selfish neighbour)- Really friendly/helpful/courteous staff. Big thanks to Cameron the concierge who couldn't have been more helpful when I realised I would need to see a doctor.- Comp coffee & newspapers from the bar area downstairs. Negatives:- ""Free"" wifi was infuriating - basically we had to keep typing in an activation code (that changed every 24 hours) every few minutes. In this day and age you'd think that a basic wifi service could be implemented that didn't keep logging you out like this.- Pity there was no coffee machine in rooms.- We didn't know there was a turndown service until reading other reviews here. We were in our room quite a lot in the early evening, but in most hotels you'd expect a card to be pushed under the door inviting you to call down to reception for the turndown if you did want it.- Limited space in wardrobes for hanging items.In conclusion, although there were a couple of small areas for improvement, this is a lovely hotel to stay and we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in DC.I surprised my wife with a weekend in Washington DC. I went with this hotel because of the good reviews. I paid a little more, but got a whole lot more. The staff were professional and friendly. The room comforts were good. The location was great. The neighborhood was a M-F so we had to use the Metro to get to more areas that were open on the weekend, but the Metro entrance was at the corner. The front desk asked why we came and my wife briefly mentioned it was an anniversary trip. Shortly after, the chief had a complementary small chocolate pastry sent to our room.We ate dessert and breakfast at the hotel. Again, service was good and the food was delicious. I will certainly be staying here again."

The room was spacious, well laid-out and beautifully appointed with furniture and fixtures. The carpet was so plush and soft. We had a very comfortable king-sized bed with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was equally luxurious as the room. Nice separate shower stall with a rainshower, gorgeous vanity and coutertop, lovely thick towels, and Lanvin toiletries- it was wonderful to enjoy and experience these amenities.The staff at the Sofitel was so gracious and hospitable.

I purchased my room on Hotwire and got an excellent price for this lovely hotel. My room was quite large - two queen beds - large desk, flat-screen tv, chair and really nice bathroom!My husband is usually not impressed with hotel rooms - and as he walked in - he commented 'WOW!' when he saw the all-marble bathroom with a nice tub and great shower stall. The check-in was a tiny issue but the woman who took care of me (Houda) was really lovely. Check-in was at 3pm and I arrived at 4:15 and my room still wasn't ready. (There aren't many rooms with two beds and the hotel was 100% sold out.) She told me that the hotel was sold out the night before and that many patrons checked out late so housekeeping wasn't able to 'turn' all the rooms yet. She offered me a drink or to store my luggage while we waited...but we really needed to get up to our room and change clothing, shoes, etc. before we could head out to the American History museum that was only open until 6 pm. She jumped through hoops for me, making calls to Housekeeping, etc....and finally our room was ready. I did wait about 10 minutes, which wasn't catastrophic, as we made it to the exhibit that I wanted to see! We loved the beds - perfect firmness. I always find it strange when hotels don't have a top sheet - and I just hope that they truly wash the duvet covers every single time! Do they?There was a nice magnified mirror in the bathroom and lots of outlets to plug things in. There was a full-size hairdryer which worked well. There were nice Lanvin toiletries.When I checked in, I was told there would be free coffee/tea in the restaurant every morning. I prefer to make my own coffee in my room while I'm getting ready. They immediately offered to send a coffee maker up to my room - which they did! I wonder why they don't just provide this in every room. Most upscale hotels do this, nowadays. Good customer service!Things I wish were slightly different: I wish the bathroom mirror was not so high up! I'm short and I could barely see in the mirror. I wish there were two sinks, but not a deal breaker. I wish the rain-head shower had a stronger stream of water - but not a deal breaker. I wish the towels were larger bathsheets - but not a deal breaker. We used the Valet parking - $50 after taxes (per night) - and we had IN/OUT privileges, which we definitely used. You text them your number with 15 minutes' warning...and the car is waiting! Expensive, but we had no choice, as we needed it to get back to BWI.We checked out around 11 am but had one more museum to visit prior to leaving for the airport at 3 pm. We checked our luggage with the Sofitel and the service was quick and perfect.ONLY complaint: We could literally find NO PLACE moderate to eat a quick breakfast anywhere nearby. The hotel's restaurant charged $15 for 2 eggs with toast and a side. We thought that was WAY TOO expensive!Overall - we LOVED the Sofitel - great room, wonderful bathroom, amazing service, efficient! I highly recommend it!"

Given that wifi is pretty much a utility these days, a $400 a night hotel should provide this FOC IMHO!Everything in the room was very good, very clean nice bathroom and waterfall shower.Ate in the restaurant for breakfast on the Saturday and was pretty good, although as usual in the US way too much for a UK appetite....The bar area on the sidewalk is a pretty cool hangout, but as you would expect pretty pricy!Great location if visiting the main sights in town. A 2 minute walk to the White House and easily accessible to most other locations. Only in town for the day so after a high speed tour, ended up going shopping in Georgetown, which is highly recommended too!"

The hotel is conveniently located to the White House, National Mall and the McPherson Metro Station. The staff is friendly, addresses you by name and provides EXCELLENT service. I would like to compliment Aziza in guest relations for her warmth & hospitality in making me feel so welcome from the time I confirmed my 4 night reservation until the time I left for home.My room was quite large with a dressing area and marble bathroom. Two sets of large windows provided sunlight and a city view. A couch and chair bordered a square glass table, A Bose radio was a nice touch and it was set to classical music when the bed was turned down for the evening ( a very nice touch). Room service was prompt and courteous. The croissants are not to be missed and are served with your morning coffee.I will definitely return to the Sofitel."

There was a bit of a rough start to our stay but after that smooth sailing.Upon arriving at the hotel (after a 15 hour flight) our room wasn't ready (we did let the hotel know we would be arriving in the morning). They wanted to upgrade us to a better room but that room wasn't ready until almost 6 hours later - this was disappointing) So we ended up leaving our bags with the hotel to explore.

In that order. What I like most about the Sofitel is the sophisticated and tasteful interior design. Very modern, like the W, but a little more upmarket. Little details, like the waitresses designer belts or the Brigitte Bardot foto series make the tasteful difference. Of course, the W's rooftop terrace is unbeatable, but the Sofitel's streetlevel terrace has one big advantage: there is a smoker's section that allows the big boys to smoke their cigars. An oasis of liberty! Also it is nice that there is no wait-to-be seated or excessive security presence or all that other paternalistic stuff that suffocates individuals."

NEGATIVES#1- Standard rooms are small, my particular room had a lovely view of the office across the street, I could see people working, I had to keep the curtains closed at all times. BUMMER#2- Bathroom, all though nice, had no lock... oy! Many embarrassing moments. #3- LE BAR- 3 cranberry juice- 1 glass of red wine, and 1 appitizer (hummus) $67 dollars! That's insanity! I find the prices outrageous for food. Never ate there again. #4- NO POOL- It was hot and a pool would of been god sent, however they did offered for us to use the facilities at The Fairmont, at a cost though it's not complimentary. $25 PP and $15 per child. I found this to be quite ridiculous and very expensive. For a party of 4 (2 of them being children) $80 dollars. I found this a little unfair for us to pay, they should at least offer to cover a portion, or maybechildren are free... something like that. #5- BED- It was ok... nothing beats a JW Marriott bed... NOTHING... Sorry Sofitel but hands down JW beats you in the Bed area.. Thats my review... it's pretty good, but they need to analyze the food prices better and the pool situation. Would I stay there again???? If Ritz or JW is available I will stay there first... and then the Sofitel. Thats my review. Enjoy"

We were extremely pleased with every aspect of the hotel. The service was excellent. The doormen were and parking attendants were extremely friendly and knowledgable. They made our two year old feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. They brought us a toddler size spa robe and fresh baked cookies almost immediately after our arrival. They remembered his name and would high five him as we left and arrived every day. The bathroom and amenities were some of the best I've had during my travels. The only negative would be the service in the restaurant but I think it was the case of one employee. After we we were seated three additional tables were seated. The waiter took their drink orders and in some cases food orders before bothering with us. In this case I think it was because we had a small child with us and I'm assuming he did not think we were staying at the hotel. We got up and left after sitting for 20 minutes. However, you can see that it didn't deter me from giving the hotel 5 stars, still an excellent experience. We will look for Sofitel's in other ciites. Another positive was our hotel maid. We were on a irregular schedule, but she came in the morning with fresh towels and in the evening to turn down our bed. She would place my son's stuffed animals on the bed for him, very sweet."

For example: on one of the last days we were there, we got caught in a HUGE rainstorm....we were drenched! and when we walked into the lobby...the STAFF came out of the woodwork with towels, called our children BY NAME and helped us all dry off immediately. another incredible piece of service: we had plans to take a 2.5 hour trolley ride with the children looking at monuments....the bar staff packed the most DARLING wicker picnic basket....fresh cookies and milk and water for the kids and 2 bottles of wine (uncorked) with cups and cheese and crackers for the moms (!!!) and LAST story....they let my AUNT bring her dog to meet us for breakfast on the patio!!! was the nicest thing to do..... i travel at least 60 nights a year for workand with my family another 24 days or so...i have very RARELY come across this level of KINDNESS and FRIENDLY service. only in europe has my child experienced such a WELCOME feeling. it makes a huge difference for children to feel they are not in the way and it can make an entire vacation all the more enjoyable when they feel a part of the scene. i would HIGHLY recommend the Sofitel in washington DC. the BEST family trip in a very long time. thank you SO much! we will be back.......xoxo the wrubels."

French-owned, it is blessedly independent of American hotel standards. In Europe (and much of touristic Asia and Africa) the hotels are better, the restaurants are better, the airlines are better -basically everything is better. Sofitel gives you all that (except the better health care).My room was extremely quiet, absolutely no street noise. I felt I was out of the city completely. My windows faced 15th street and I had a lovely view; not a vista, mind you, but Daniel Burnham's stately Southern Building (1914) across the street is quite impressive and a delight to observe as the sun casts varying shadows on its facade. My room was not extravagantly expansive but it was more than spacious enough. Everything was where it should be, and the work area was quite broad, with plenty of outlets. The windows were tall and flooded the room with light, even in the afternoon. There were many electric lights carefully placed throughout the room and bathroom. The art on the walls was beautiful, speaking of a desire to fulfill higher standards of excellence and taste, not just the minimum for business. The bed was comfortable and attractive, the comforter and pillows apparently of down or down substitute. The bathroom was very well constructed (no sloppy grouting and tiling here), the closet space easy to use, the television sharp, and the seating very comfortable. I could have stayed there a long time. The hallways and elevators and lobby all reflect the same standards of excellence and attention to detail as in the room. The clientele is very chic and smart, of all ages but many in the young 30s and 40s. I'm surprised that Sofitel is not always booked to the rafters, because here you get far more than at other comparable hotels (like the Fairfax at Embassy Row, and Ritz Pentagon City), and you are only a few blocks from the White House. The room service was the best I've had by far in DC. I've ordered room service at the Ritz Pentagon City, the Fairfax Embassy Row, a major Dulles hotel, and many other hotels in the US and Europe, and this is my favorite so far. (The Ritz Pentagon City's room service bill said ""Marriott"" on it; I can only assume they contract out for that, which explains why the Ritz food is bland and in no way fits anyone's conception of a Ritz standard.) At Sofitel some of the food may also be a bit on the pre-fab side of things, but it is definitely several steps up. Tea comes in a lovely heavy pot, very Asian in style. The bread you'd find in a good patisserie. The main dishes are thoughtfully prepared and very fresh. You definitely eat well, and I can't wait to try the Bistro itself next time I'm in town. Cons: The shower has a rain-style shower head, which is pleasant but for me does not provide nearly enough pressure to get that aaah feeling. It's like somebody massaging your back but not quite finding the knots. I felt that some of the staff were being too aggressive in seeking tips. The room smelled and looked very clean, except for a piece of terry cloth lint and a pencil shaving on the floor. The carpet needs updating; it's that kind of deep pile that changes color with heavy traffic, so it looks light on the sides and dark in the middle of the room. And I don't know if this is a con, but probably so for those thinking in feng shui terms: the bathroom doors (they are french doors with frosted windows) open directly onto the side of the bed. I'm guessing the designer wanted the doors to face the large windows to bring in natural light - and I have to agree with her/him that this enhances the bathroom tremendously and prevents it from seeming like a dark carve. Just be sure to close the doors when you don't need the bathroom.I stayed at the Sofitel for two nights. I was expecting super swanky but what I got was really comfortable. Customer service was first rate and what's not to like when someone greats you with a bit of friendly French!? The Sofitel is located conveniently to K Street, the White House and a Metro stop. My bed was super comfortable with soft down pillows and a down comforter. The had terrific body care products and a nice white robe with slippers. Loved it! My only complaint: I don't like paying for internet access ($9.95 per 24 hour period)"

We booked on a 'Prepaid 40% off sale' rate which made the hotel rate excellent value for money and we had excellent stay. Superb service from the hotel's excellent Guest Relations Manager, the front desk team and concierge, which included arranging transportation from Dulles prior to our arrival.The hotel has a perfect location and we were able to walk to most sights and down to the museums along the Mall. There are also metro stations nearby and the White House is just around the corner. Our room was one of the larger suites on the street side of the building and on the top floor and was filled with light. A really fantastic room. Bed, bathroom, towels and amenities all on form as you would expect from Sofitel.My only gripe would be the coffee machine and paper cups in the room. On arrival there were 4 paper cups which we used over the course of an evening and the following morning. These were replenished then used again. Then they weren't replenished so there was nothing to drink out of. New cups were delivered on request but it seemed a little odd and personally I would have preferred real cups in the room (plus a Nespresso machine - which are becoming a familiar sight in most Sofitel rooms these days). Other than that our stay was perfect and I wished we could have stayed for longer. If I am in Washington DC again I would certainly choose this hotel."

Ordered room service late at night after attending a show at the Kennedy Center and again everything was without hassle. Plus it was REALLY good food. The decor was beautiful and the room was large. The bathroom was the best part of the entire room.

The Whitehouse is a 5 min walk away and we were luck to see Marine One, the Presidents Helicopter coming in to land and then take off.The staff at the hotel are ultra courteous and very slick, maybe to slick for my liking but that’s the nature of the hotel, very ""flash"".I used the valet parking for the Chevy Camaro that we had and they were very efficient in my opinion, the car on average took only about 10 minutes to be bought around.My only problem with the hotel is that when I booked online the price I was quoted included all taxes. When I checked out it was more and was charged the taxes.One word of warning for anyone travelling in the USA, when you book and or check in, ask what are the local fee's, charges, taxes and also what are the hotels fee's and charges as this will save you a massive surprise at check oy as we found with other hotels on our trip.I have not chased up the problem with the taxes with the Sofitel and I will not as I now have no proof what the original quote was. My advice to you is take a screen shot of the booking screen or if you get an email with the quote, KEEP IT.Would I stay here again, no, why, its nice for a honeymoon but not for general travel in my opinion. If you want some romance and flash hotel then by all means stay at the the Sofitel in Lafayette square."

(Make sure you hide the bottle of wine in the parks as you are not supposed to drink alcoholic beverages!)The hotel was perfectly situated in the heart of sightseeing DC. Minutes walk away from the Whitehouse and other monuments and memorials.We enjoyed the food in the restaurant and had breakfast there every morning.The staff were always friendly and helpful, particularly when American Airlines lost my finaces luggage which went missing for an entire evening!The concierge were helpful when we needed assisstace with tours we had booked. I had already booked them independently after reading lots of poor reviews of large tour companies in DC. We boked the Segway tour (which was excellent and well worth doing!!) and a private tour with Larry Clark from Tiber Creek tours (exceptional service!!).A great hotel and worth the expense!"

Everyone is so warm, helpful and friendly. I love the French flavour of the hotel - the entire building exudes class and professionalism. My first day here was my birthday; when I returned to my room that evening Sarah (at the front desk) had arranged to have a dessert waiting in my room, along with a lovely personalized letter to mark the occasion. Talk about making you feel welcome! The room is immaculate, the bed is ridiculously comfy (I want a SObed!!), the restaurant serves exceptional food, and the location is first rate.

Dinner was of a high standard as well. Overall, the experience was superb but one little thing let them down. For the rates they were charging, it would be a nice gesture to provide free wifi in all rooms. Not that US$10 per 24hrs for wifi would break the bank account ( considering the rates we already have to pay for rooms ) but this is the 21st century and most people will be using some form of internet!

My boyfriend and I stayed here from July 3-July, 5th 2010. when we arrived very early in the morning hoping that we could just have our bags held untill our room was ready. It was probably around 9am. Sure enough when we arrived at the front desk, we were told our room was ready and on the highest floor as my boyfriend had requested. The room looked just like it did in the pictures, very clean, nice bathroom (besides the ball of hair in the shower!) the bed was very comfortable. The concierege was very helpful and gave us tickets to the holocaust museum that we could use at any time during the day. (unlike the timed entry passes that they give you at the museum). They were also able to get us very last minute 4th of July reservations at Filominas(you must try it!) a very popular restaurant in Georgetown. On our last morning, we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was delicious. The one thing that would make this place perfect would be a pool! Overall We had a very enjoyable stay and even though I always like trying out different hotels, i would definitely consider going back to the Sofitel for another stay if we return to D.C."

My husband and I decided to take a trip to Washington for his 50th birthday. He's a political junkie and history buff so Washington fit the bill. Sofitel is a great little hotel. If you can do without a pool or spa, then this is the place to stay. It's in a great location, Only two blocks from the White House we spent our Saturday walking the Mall from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument to the Capital. A great experience.Food:We found the food quite delicious, we got the package with breakfast included, and we had it twice in the restaurant and once as room service. In all instances the food tasty bread pastries were delicious, the little smoothies a nice touch, the juice fresh, and the coffee excellent served in your own bodum coffee press. We didn't eat in the restaurant for other meals, there are so many choices in DC, but we did sit in the out door lounge after a long day of site seeing for a drink, the staff was attentive, the beer cold and the couch seating comfortable. Rooms Not large, but very comfortable with all the amenties, including a lovely large marble bathroom with nice lemon scented bath products. I liked the hotel touches of silvers, overhead bed reading lights, an iron and ironing board, 24 hour room service and nightly turndown service. There's a handy plug in for the laptop, but as with most hotels no free wifi, you have to hook up with AT and T. The bed was very very comfortable and the hotel is quiet. We love that. Transportation We mostly either walked or took a cab to our destination which normally was under $10 to get to where we wanted to go, such as dinner Georgetown. Our first evening in DC, we hired a town car service after our dinner. David took us around the Capital at night, we saw the Lincoln Memorial, the FDR, the Jefferson, the Korean etc. He let us get out and take night pictures, which was very nice, and it oriented ourselves for our own exploring the next day. Sofitel did feel like a little bit of Paris in Washington and that's just fine for us.We have been reward members with another hotel for years, however, we found a great rate for the Sofitel in DC and decided to give it a try. The hotel location is amazing; right around the corner from the McPherson Metro Station, The White House, Old Ebbitt Grille, etc, etc. We were greeted by the hotel staff immediately and did not have to wait in line during check in. They also provided us with a map of DC/the metro which we used during our trip. Our reservation was upgraded to a corner room on the 8th floor. We never waited in line for a elevator. We stayed during the hottest weekend this summer so far and the air conditioning was always set to the right temperature. Our room was large and it had the best closet I have ever seen in a hotel. The room felt luxurious, the carpet was plush (unlike so many other hotels). The bathroom was nice with a separate shower/tub and large vanity. The bed was very comfortable. Our room was serviced each day (I suppose between 12-4). Our bed was turned down each night.One thing that stood out was how quiet the hotel was. We could not hear any other guests. When housekeeping was in the next room I had no idea until I opened the door (usually you can hear the vacuum cleaner). Overall our stay was just perfect, absolutely no complaints. I'm looking forward to visiting other Sofitel hotels in the future as this one exceeded our expectations."

Unfortunately, our experience did not live up to expectation! We did not receive any help with our bags when arriving, and found most of the front-desk staff to be aloof and arrogant - for instance, they would not say 'hello' to us when we approached, but instead waited for us to speak to them.The TV and air-conditioner in our room did not work properly from the moment we arrived. Our room service (dinner) was overcharged on two separate occasions and on a third, the wrong order was delivered. Perhaps the most shocking, our room was not serviced (cleaned) on two days during our stay. The first time this happened, we rang house-keeping and requested the room to be cleaned and it still did not get done. The second time we arrived back to our room around 4:15pm, after a day travelling in severe heat/humidity, to find our room still dirty.We raised all of these issues with one of the hotel managers and fortunately, he understood our concerns and acknowledged that all of these things should not have occured. As a result, one night's accommodation was deducted from our bill. This did make up, somewhat, for the inconveniences that we experienced but as this was a 'once ina lifetime' trip, we would have preferred to give the stress and frustration a miss.We decided to stay in this hotel as part of our honeymoon to the US, from the moment we stepped through the door the staff were welcoming and helpful. The staff member we spoke to on the front desk was polite and friendly, had knowledge of the part of the UK we come from and talked to us about home.The lobby and halls are just as well kept as the rooms, clean and comfortable with adequate seating, black out blinds and a large wonderful bed! This has to be one of the most comfortable beds we've encountered on our travels, the pillows were just right but if they're not to your suiting there's even a pillow menu to choose from!The bathroom was well appointed with great touches such a fresh lowers and L'Occitane toiletries, the tub wasn't quite big enough for two but the shower was spacious and powerful, perfect for an early morning wake up to get out and see the city!A large LCD TV graces the corner of the room with plenty of channels, SD and HD to choose from, plenty of storage is available plus a mini bar and safe.We ordered room service one morning which was delivered on time with extras, we didn't get a chance to dine at the restaurant in the hotel but we found Old Ebbitt Grill just over a block away south on 15th, we enjoyed it so much, we went twice! If you like seafood, they have an excellent raw bar, try the oysters!The hotel is in a great location, close to the White House and within walking distance of the National Mall and the Smithsonian museums. If you have some time, try a Segway tour, we did the 3 hour evening tour with City Segway, great staff!A few negatives being no free WiFi in the hotel and I couldn't get a cell phone signal on T-Mobile whilst in our room, we had an inside room looking into the courtyard which probably blocked the signal. But these are by no means reasons not to stay in this great hotel!"

What more can you ask from a hotel?Our room was 312, overlooking H Street and 15. Not a remarkable view, but good just the same. The windows are very tall, going almost to the floor, and wide, letting in good natural light. The bed was fantastic. Clean. Comfortable.Wide too was the room itself, but not so deep. We kept bumping into each other as we went around the bed.The bath was well-appointed, with separate tub and shower. Marbled. L'Occitane toiletries. Spacious. Inviting.The room and bath were both spotless. I did notice that the door had caused some marking on the carpet, but that is insignificant to me.The hanging space in the closet was surprisingly small. I didn't measure, but thinking back I would guess about 24 inches (61 cm). Sufficient for one person in the summer with no coats, but rather tight in winter with two guests and additional cold-weather garments.The service is outstanding! I could name several names, but I will only mention two. Cristolf--at the front desk during check-in--and Chef Olivier. Christopf (sp?) was more than gracious. Amiable, inviting, inducing in us a sense of welcome to a very high-class hostelry. He's the kind of person you'd love to have as a friend.We met the chef after mentioning how delicious our food was one night while dining in the bar. Our attendant, unbeknownst to us, went and brought the chef to our table. Olivier is also gracious as well as talented. We enjoyed meeting him and thought this was a good gesture on our server's part.During the stay we encountered no problem. We met no sour employee. We were displeased in no way. The staff is top-notch and truly personable.By the way, being greeted in French throughout the stay was an added, delightful treat for someone who did not progress past saying, ""Welcome to my humble chapeau.""Value? Well, I will let you decide. Français hospitalité does not come cheaply.Bottom Line: A completely enjoyable stay and I do plan to return. It's kind of nice having the Obama family sleeping just around the corner. Nice neighborhood. I wonder if their attendants were any better than mine? I doubt it!Added Note 1: The bar was hopping Friday night with young attractive patrons. I don't know if this was due to some special holiday party or if such a beautiful crowd is typical on a weekly basis. Because of this one-time observation I am checking ""Nightlight"" in the trip description options.Added Note 2: Why do expensive, up-scale hotels charge for internet connections? That question and the meaning of life continue to puzzle me.Spent three nights here in late November. Was immediately impressed with the level of service from when we arrived to checking out. Staff are very attentive and always there to get the door for you, walk you to the lift when you check in or help with any requests. Rooms were well presented, a little on the cosy side but very comfortable. Didn't eat in the restaurant but ordered room service for breakfast which was reasonably priced and quite substantial. Ordered their Hot Chocolate for supper one night - it is to die for!!! Location is great for the White House - just around the corner. Other musuems and monuments are accessible if you don't mind a bit of a walk. Have not hesitation in recommending this establishment. First rate!"

From check-in to check-out everything was exactly as I wanted it to be. This was our first visit to DC so we utilized our concierges a lot, they were very helpful and offered great advice on how to spend our short amount of time in DC. The lobby area is very elegant, lots of dark wood, orchids, etc. There was a lounge area where you could get coffee each morning on your way out to sightsee and also a very nice restaurant where we enjoyed breakfasts, loved the complimentary smoothies that they offered there. I chose the Sofitel for the location, we wanted to be able to walk to the White House whenever we felt like it. The hotel is also a short walk to the Washington Monument and the Smithsonian museums. Our room was beautiful, a comfy king bed, we had a view of the city. Everything was first-class and the bathroom was stunning. A huge soaking tub, glass shower, lovely amenities, lots of granite countertop space for your things. There is also a nice sized HD TV in the room and I loved our view of the city from our room. It is very convenient to catch a cab from this hotel, they usually had a couple of them parked outside of the hotel, we used them a lot of rides to restaurants and Arlington Cemetery. When we return again to the area, we will stay at The Sofitel. Our room was under $200 a night also, we had a King Deluxe room which was perfect. I highly recommend this hotel while visiting our nation's capitol. :)It takes a lot for me to give something 5 stars on Trip Advisor and the Sofitel in Washington, DC almost got it from me, but there was one, very minor problem which prevented me from giving it 5 stars. One of the things that I loved about this hotel is that it was so clean! When we first walked in our room I could smell the disinfectant in the bathroom (since the bathroom was immediately to the left when we opened the door to our room). It felt reassuring to know that the room was so clean. I'm not sure why some people have complained that the rooms are small. Maybe they've never stayed in a city hotel before? We had a basic King room and it was large. I do have to say that the bathroom really offered no privacy to speak of. The door to the bathroom is kind of see through and apparently Sofitel does not believe in having fans in the bathroom. I'm just saying.... :-)For the most part the service was great during our entire stay. The first night I checked out the mini bar and there was a old half eaten sandwich from the last guests. Because the minibar is one of those with a sensor and you get charged for things that are taken out, I did not want to just remove it and throw it away. I let the front desk know about the situation and the woman told me that it would be taken care of. The maids do not attend to the minibars by the way. They have a separate person that does that duty. When we got back to our room late Saturday afternoon I checked the minibar and the sandwich was still there. I called to the front desk again and this time (different person at front desk) someone was sent to our room immediately to service the minibar.We would definitely stay at this hotel again during our next visit to Washington, DC. I also wrote a review of their restaurant, Ici Urban Bisto. Had some great breakfasts there and a fabulous dinner Saturday night."

The McPhearson Square metro stop is about a block away. The White House is just around the corner. You can walk to the national mall in about 10 to 15 minutes, and we also walked to China town for dinner. We had a King room, and it was very large, and had big HD TV.

EXCELLENT service - best I've encountered.2. Level of detail (maid service, turndown service, 1 soft and 1 hard pillow per person, fresh flowers in the bathroom, etc.)3. Rooms in perfect condition. Beautiful bathroom.4. Only 1 block from a Metro stop and a few blocks from the White House itself.5. Quiet.6. Bed very comfortable. BOSE stereo alarm clock was great to have.7. We got a ""stay 2 nights, get the third one free"" on Sofitel's own website (it beat all the other sites like travelocity, expedia, etc.)CONS:1. There are sliding pocket doors for the bathroom. They don't close perfectly together and there is no lock. Not a problem for us but some may not like it.2. $40 a day for valet parking (no public parking available so you have to use it). Factor this in when comparing hotel prices.3. As with any hotel, the food/bar prices are high, very high. One draft beer and one small simple mixed drink cost $28 (including the tip). That's just crazy."

I knew it was ""upscale"" and so that was part of the cost of staying there.We used their parking which is more expensive than other lots but since it can be difficult to find parking 1. close by 2. overnight 3. safe.... The Sofitel parking provided all of that, plus fast friendly service by the doorman. We had a very quiet room at the end of a hallway. NO view from our room but the other building that blocked our view, provided blocking of street noise, so I looked at that as a plus.Our room was very clean and had a great marble shower with good water pressure. The toiletries were excellent. The bed was very comfortable. The room was warm and the temperature was a bit tricky to adjust.We went to Washington to see the Cherry Blossoms. The Sofitel was in a convenient location for us to walk there. The White House is only one block away!!! We ate at the restaurant for breakfast. That was ""expensive"" but I suppose most of Washington DC is expensive. We had a late morning, large breakfast with fabulous breads, eggs, bacon and sausage....come to think of it, we saved money because we didn't need to eat lunch!!"

I stayed in a Superior which had everything you could possibly want in it. I could not fault the room at all. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, the room immaculate, the attention to detail was second to none. One thing that really struck me was just how quiet it was, I couldn't hear any noise from other rooms, outside or from the corridor. I really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it.This hotel was such a treat. From the moment we stepped out of the cab the staff were there to greet and assist us. The hotel was very nicely decorated, a bit understated. The hotel is just a couple blocks from the White House & the National Mall and one block from a subway station, so it's very convenient to get where you need to go. The famous Old Ebbitt Grill restaurant is less than two blocks away as well - a must when dining in D.C. A deli, steakhouse and CVS are also very close in proximity to the hotel. Our room was very comfortable, the view lacked a little to be desired (we were on the third floor), and the sliding bathroom door was a bit difficult to close,(it stuck a few times) but otherwise very nice. The bathroom held a nice vase with beautiful orchids on the day we arrived, but each day after sat empty, and we were only given two bath towels each day, which when the termperature is in the 90's means you'll be calling for extra towels often, and unfortunately the staff were very slow to respond on two occasions. The bed was very comfortable, but did not have a top sheet - you'll have to request one. The room had a a large desk, flat screen television, safe and closet - room enough for all our luggage. The hotel was very quiet, we never heard a noise while in our room. We ordered room service several times during our week-long stay and each time the food was delicious and the service prompt, and actually the prices weren't too bad. For the most part the service and entire stay was excellent. I'd definitely stay there again. Just a tip, we were there the week of Labor Day and while it was hot it was a wonderful time to visit D.C. We never stood in line to see anything! We visited the Washington Monument at almost 4 p.m. and were able to get tickets and go right to the top, which is usually unheard of - the tickets for that momument are typically gone by 9 a.m. or so. There's so much to see in D.C., plan far in advance (several places, such as the Pentagon, White House, etc. require two-plus month requests for tickets) and wear really comfortable shoes - you'll do lots of walking."

Excellent location - 2 blocks from Metro station McPhearson. Few blocks from the White House.Check in was smooth. We were initially given a spacious room on the 9th floor - which had the cream carpet that were stained as mentioned in previous review. We immediately phone front desk who gave us another room on the 2nd floor. The bell man met us at the old room with the new room keys. 2nd floor room was located at the front of the hotel immediatley above the main entrance, and near the ballrooms. The carpets had been replaced in this room - a nice light brown/cream in color - nice and clean. Slightly smaller than the other room, but it was extremly comfortable. If we could have packed away the bed we would have. Extremly comfortable. Plenty of towels, nightgown + sleepers, Bose stereo system and flatscreen tv all added to the comfort. The evening turn down service and the complimentary bottle of evian was a nice treat. They even replaced and tidied the bathroom during that time. It was a nice rsurprise to come back to. We dined in the bistro ICI for both lunch and breakfast. Both come highly recommended. We indulged in room service breakfast for our last morning. Fablous!! We also had drinks in the main bar which has a lovely calming atmosphere.From start to finish, the staff were extremly pleasant and made us feel 100% welcome. We have no hesitation in recommending Sofitel for location, comfort and customer service. All in all a gem of a hotel. Will definitely be staying in Sofitel for rest of our visits."

We were celebrating our anniversary and we wanted to make it a special stay so we booked this hotel and we are so glad we did. The building is absolutely gorgueous, the staff was really friendly (our first inclination was that we wouldnt be treated as well as people with alot of money would, however we were proven wrong). The concierge was super helpful with dinner reservations and the door man was always attentive. The rooms were awsome. Very clean and very roomy, our view was amazing and the bathroom was beautiful. The only negative thing i can say about it is the no flat sheet thing, not sure the reasoning behind that. We did not try the restaurants only because we had other places we wanted to check out around the city. However we did order room service a few times and the food was very good. We did go to Mortins Steakhouse and we loved every bite of it. There is a starbucks down the street and a few delis as well. The only other issue we had was having to pay for valet parking, although parking is at a premium in the city, considering the price per night they could have included that for no extra charge. I guess you pay for convinience! I would def stay here again if i could afford it and i would def stay at another sofitel hotel!It is alot easier to show pictures then explain in detail what it all looked like so I've included pictures with captions.

The staff were without exception welcoming and friendly. The room was refreshingly modern and immaculate. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was well supplied and beautiful.There were some downsides. The fridge contents had an electronic lock, so that if you removed anything, you would get charged. We had asked the front desk (twice) to empty it so we could put our own things in, but it didn’t happen, and we gave up. Also, the downtown location of the hotel allowed convenient access to the National Mall, but at night, the area was quite empty, and felt a little lonely. However, being only a block from the MacPherson Sq. metro stop meant one could go anywhere for livelier nightlife.I paid $205 to 215 per night, which was an early-bird prepaid rate off their hotel website. Overall, I was pleased with my experience and would stay there again"

The Sofitel is located one block from the White House and a few blocks from the Washington Monument/National Mall. Rooms were spacious with an LG flat screen TV, walk in shower, large bath tub, am amazing selection of toiletry items, and a comfy king size bed. The room also contained a large amount of storage (closets) for those who may have an extended stay at the property. The vanity lights were pretty amazing (check out some of the candid pictures). The hotel hallways were decorated with modern art and blooming orchids. There was always an elevator open and waiting for us in the lobby to take us to our room level--never had to wait. What amazed me the most about the Sofitel was the friendliness of the staff. Each time we entered the hotel, we were engaged in conversation by at least 3 employees. Conversations ranged from how our holiday was to asking if we needed directions, sightseeing advice, etc. It really made us feel at home and we liked the personal touch. We ate at Café 15 on Sunday for breakfast. I had an amazing mushroom omelet with toast/potatoes and my wife had eggs benedict. Portions were very large and I felt the prices were reasonable for downtown DC. Only negative about the Sofitel is the parking situation near the property--I'm sure it's quite difficult during the week. The hotel does offer valet but it is a bit pricey. Since we were there on a holiday weekend, we opted to park on the street outside of the hotel. Travel Tip--Parking is free with no time limit from Friday evening until Monday morning in downtown DC. We left our car and walked or took the metro everywhere.I would stay at the Sofitel again in a heartbeat. We obtained a great rate for this property via Hotwire."

We booked a suite at the last minute and loved everything except there was no view. Had we booked earlier, we would have expected a good view, but we only decided to go a few days before the reservation. We liked the stylish decor (there's a real orchid in the bathroom) and loved the featherbed with the duvet. I personally am skeptical of the cleanliness of hotel comforters, so I was pleased to see a duvet cover that is laundered after each stay.The bathroom was gorgeous, although there was only one robe. The toiletries had a nice scent and there was even a loofa for the tub.The room was very quiet even though we were close to the elevators. We never heard another guest. There was a nice foyer before walking into the sitting room. This room had a desk with chair with plenty of space. There is a charge for internet service. The sitting room also had a nice couch and chair where we could relax and enjoy our breakfast. The bedroom was average size and comfortable, with reading lamps on each side of the bed, a safe and iron in the closet, and effective blackout curtains.The pay per view was broken on our tv, but maintenance was at our door within 20 minutes to fix it and we received 2 calls later on to make sure it was working alright.The most amazing part of the stay was room service. The first night, we were too full from our delicious dinner at Ceiba (fabulous Latin American food) to have dessert, so we ordered profiteroles and coffee later from room service. It arrived in about 15 minutes and was very good. For breakfast both mornings, we ordered room service. It arrived in about 20-25 minutes. The food was fresh and delicious (brioche french toast, eggs benedict, freshly squeezed orange juice, good strong coffee), and the first morning we had complimentary small glasses of banana honey smoothie. Both mornings they included complimentary whole fruit that we snacked on later in the day.The front desk was busy but pretty helpful. We did not use the concierge. The bellmen were extremely nice and helpful.We would definitely stay again - location was great. We walked to the Mall and all the museums. The immediate area has little to no shopping, but there are a few restaurants. This is a business area, so Starbucks closed at 6 pm, which was disappointing to us. We did not visit the bar or the restaurant. The weekends are much more inexpensive. Expect to pay at least $100 more per night during the week."

We were not disappointed.The hotel is ideally situated within walking, if you like walking, distance to all the major buildings and museums in central Washington. We even walked to Arlington cemetery (which is across the river) after visiting the Lincoln memorial, although we did take the metro back.It is a lovely experience, well decorated and furnished. The bed is one of the nicest and most comfortable we have found on our travels. The room was spacious as was the bathroom. I have no complaints. A little pricey perhaps but this is in the heart of the business area. Maybe the price is right and it is me that doesn't usually pay that sort of rate.My wife felt that the tiles in the shower hadn't been kept up to. To be honest I wouldn't have noticed but she pointed out that, whilst they appeared clean to me, they had a film on that does appear in showers and needs constant attention to keep under control. She is fastidious and I would suggest most wouldn't know what she was talking about.Three very comfortable nights, restaurants close at hand, metro also but get the legs going and enjoy the visit. We arranged to pick up hire car after our DC visit so as not to incur hire / parking charges for three days / nights that were not necessary."

I booked in part because of the great reviews & in part the great location. The location did, indeed, not disappoint. It is blocks from wonderful bars & restaurants. It is exactly 3 blocks from the white house. There is a Starbucks 1/2 block away & the metro is one block away.... you can't ask for more!The service was also wonderful. I emailed the hotel to ask how to book a room with 2 beds, as you can't do it on their website. He said to book via telephone &, when I followed up, he said he'd put me in for an upgrade based on availability. I was pleased and shocked to be upgraded at no extra cost to a deluxe room with a separate sitting area, especially considering that it was the cherry blossom festival. We were rarely at the hotel and the doorman remembered us! I emailed the hotel about a few recommendations after our stay and they responded politely and promptly.The room was very well decorated, modern, and clean. I am a self-admitted clean freak, so it is impressive for me to say that it was extremely clean, except that the bedskirts had stains on them, which I reported to the staff. The toiletries were very nice. (we did not get welcome drinks, though, as reported in other reviews) The beds had down overlays along with duvets: very comfortable. The shower had great water pressure. The only other negative thing I could find was the TV internet was quite poor: slow & inefficient, even when run by someone who works in IT!Overall, spendy, but money well spent.

Before I begin though, I must say that using TripAdvisor has become second nature for me before I book any of my trips - short or long. I highly recommend them to one and all! Because of all the excellent reviews I read prior to making my reservation, we picked this hotel.My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sofitel from July 1 to July 3...we arrived from New York at 11:30am and amazingly, our room was ready! I had taken the time to join up for the Sofitel Privilege card (free on their website) thus allowing early check-in. We were also entitled to late check-out ( uo to 4pm) at no additional cost. The doorman , valet, bellhop and front desk manager were all friendly. courteous and extremely gracious. Our luggage arrived at our room 1 minute after we did..and what a magnificent room! I had upgraded to a deluxe king with a city view contacting Sofitel direct ( fantastic rate- $145 per night) and it was absolutely beautiful! Luxurious and spotless.a corner room with windows facing out onto 15th street. I cannot stress how immaculate the room was...furnishings on the modern side , many fluffy pillows on the bed and a super soft duvet. The bath had a separate glass enclosed shower and separate tub. While not exceptionally deep, it served the purpose rather well. The water pressure was strong and the water as hot as you wanted. Toiletries and towels well supplied. The front closet had a safe and I especially liked the storage for shoes and drawers...well out of sight. While the room had no refrigerator or coffee maker, we managed to be creative. I brought along a small cooler from home to hold water, coffee creamer and other assorted goodies. As the ice machine was right outside, we just kept replenishing as needed. The hotel offers a complimentary coffee bar from 6:30am to 10am in their downstairs lounge. We just filled a carafe and brought it up to the room. Excellent coffee.On our first night, after a long day of sightseeing, we decided to order room service. My boyfriend called to inquire about the crabcake burger. The young lady who answered wasn't sure of the reply and had the chef call our room to converse with my boyfriend! I was completely amazed and impressed!! If that is not service, then I don't know what is! The food was hot, delicious and delivered quickly. So that the tables don't stay in your room or in the hallway, all you do is call and they will retrieve it for you upon completion. The conceirge gave us a list of restaurants in the Chinatown area (about 7-8 blocks away) and we brought in takeout on our second evening.The air-conditioning worked well and the room was well sound-proofed. Turn-down service is provided if you like. My request for extra towels, pillows and soap was handled promptly and with a smile. The only suggestion I have is provide two robes if there are two guests. The valet brought our car quickly with no problems. Check-out was quick, the bill was correct and the conceirge answered all of our questions and more. For me, there is NO other hotel in Washington! We take many short weekend trips and have for quite a few years. I have to say that this hotel is in my top two ever and I cannot think of a higher compliment to give them!We spoke to the day manager, Mr. Fix, about booking for later this year and he advised us to call him so he could arrange for our room and any other requests we might have. Service above and beyond. As you can see, I cannot say enough wonderful things about the Sofitel Lafayette Square but don't take my word for it - stay there and experience it for yourselves!"

The Pluses:The rooms were beautiful (see pics). Beds have a down mattress pad that is very soft but not to soft, baths have full shower and tub. Bathroom products are standard Sofitel which means Roger et Gallet which is excellent. Beautiful heavy curtains that blocked out the light well. Staff was outstanding. The concierge was very helpful and helped us with restaurant ideas and reservations on more than one occassion. We had eaten at Old Ebbitts near the hotel on our own and had to wait 1h20 mins for a table. latter in the trip we wanted to eat there again and the concierge was able to secure a reservation for the same evening only 2 hours in advance. Saved us the wait and we were given a very nice table. Room service breakfast was a fair value at 14 dollars for a continental with fresh squeezed juice, croissants, raisin danish and coffee. The bar was a hopping place and seemed well liked amoung locals. its a short walk to the White House and a quick metro ride to the Mall.The Minuses:Housekeeping is usually outstanding in Sofitels however, I felt it was only good in this hotel. The rooms were always clean and the beds well made but they did not do the little extras like straighten up the room when clothes,book, shoes, belts etc. were about. They never changed the fresh flowers in the 8 nights we were there so they were quite dead. They often forgot to leave the room service breakfast order form.With the exception of breakfast the room service menu was over priced and uninteresting. The hotel restaurant was also uninspiring and pricey.Although close to the sites, it is a business area so it clears out at 6 pm and is very dead on the weekend. There are very few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel that are open for dinner. Terrible view from the window. Check it out in my photos. We had two rooms, both with the same view. From looking at the floor map it looked like several rooms on each floor had this type of view. Be sure to ask for a room facing the street if you like to look out the window."

The catering services were nice and the meeting rooms were more than adequate. All of the staff I had interacted with were friendly and helpful. The room I had was next to the air handler systems on the first floor - so there was a little noise that would occur and wake me. The room itself was clean and tidy. A few wallpaper areas that were peeling and windows that were for the most part - unopenable (but thankfully as it seemed as though the walkway on the roof was being used at times). The curtains were torn in spots and pull handles were missing. Ok, Shower pressure nice, clean bathroom. Once I pulled out the coffee maker and used my coffee allotment they made sure it was stocked for me. I never drank the complementary water. My mistake. The WiFi was acceptable.Allowed me to do the work I needed there.However conference room WiFi seemed sporadic. Location, well, I couldn't ask for a better location. A few minutes walk and we were at the zoo watching the pandas eat. Walking down Calvert Street we headed into some of the best food establishments I have ate at.The lounge at the hotel had a nice variety of beers on tap, mostly local which I was happy to try,Overall it is a very nice place, but try to get a room at least on the second floor."

The hotel is lovely with an exceptional staff. From the valet to the front desk everyone went above and beyond to engage with my girls. Typically it can be a little intimidating traveling with 3 little girls, but everyone was very welcoming. The front desk gave them each a little backpack with goodies, which started the trip great. The room was very spacious with great linens and bathrobes. The pool was lovely and warm enough for evening swims in October. The concierge gave great advice on age appropriate ideas. Plus the location is so easy to walk to many restaurants, coffee and of course the zoo. Felt very safe in the neighborhood walking with children, and would highly recommend this location to be out of the downtown chaos but close enough to travel easily to the museums. Only negative would be more pillows, however I never called to order more. It was a great trip and I highly recommend.We had a large room which had a separate bathroom area, a table for the laptop, a walk in closet, nice amenities and big towels.There is no breakfast offered and the dining room and the bar have very slow service and are expensive but there are other options nearby."

The hotel is no more than two blocks from a Metro station, so I was able to take the Metro from National Airport to get to the hotel. The immediate area has several restaurants - both chains such as McDonald's and Chipotle - plus local restaurants specializing in Indian, Chinese and American foods. The hotel is close to the National Zoo and Rock Creek National Park The staff at the front desk were friendly and efficient - at both check in and check out. I had a room with a king size bed that overlooked the outdoor hotel pool. The room was spacious, with a walk-in closet. The bed was very comfortable with many pillows. There was a desk and chair, dresser and an arm chair with ottoman. The room was clean and well-maintained. The bathroom had a tub with shower and the usual assortment of toiletries. There was plenty of hot water and good pressure from the shower. The meeting rooms for the conference we're typical of upscale hotels. The played lunch was very good. The grounds were great - with fountains and landscaping with lots of flowers.Would definitely recommend this hotel."

The Duke Ellington bridge was a block down to the right and there were loads of options for food. My daughter and father really enjoyed the Jazz evening. Can I also say the Buffalo wings were amazing? Like huge surprise! The pool, while not deep was very relaxing. Wish the hot tub was a bit bigger but it was still ok. The outdoor area was beautiful and really made the hotel stand out. The historic events that happened at the hotel are displayed as well. The Beatles stayed there as well as Good ole Blue eyes himself. We had a terrific stay and hope to return again soon!"

I was in DC to attend a political conference. We were upgraded to the Ronald Reagan suite which was absolutely amazing! The customer service was Five star and so were our accommodations. The location was perfect. It was close enough to downtown area but still quiet and peaceful. The grounds and gardens were beautiful. We didn’t have the opportunity to enjoy the pool or spa due to our busy schedule but were able to sit down for the breakfast buffet. The buffet was fresh and full of diverse options for meat lovers or vegetarians.This is a historical hotel that was built in 1933. However, it still looks very elegant and very clean. It’s one of a few inaugural hotels by the way. I would highly recommend the Omni Shoreham hotel to anyone visiting the DC area."

On entrance there are lots of facts about various films it has been featured in. The Beatles also played here in the early 1960's and there is an actual play list on one of the displays. Considering the hotels age it doesnt feel particularly tired although it did take along time for the water to heat up when having a bath. Breakfast was literally fantastic and reasonable value for money considering the quality of the food on offer. The outdoor pool and sauna facilities are great and included in the room fee.

However, management jumped in to not only get me into a room but to upgrade me to a Presidential Suite! All I can say is, Wow. This suite is exceptionally roomy and so lovely, as well. I will say that some modern conveniences are missing--handy outlets, for example, and although there is a microwave and full refrigerator, I don't have any plates or silverware. However, the historic beauty of the hotel, comfort of the bed and friendliness of the staff makes it all okay. I love that they remember to deliver my newspaper in the morning (local as requested), and that the wifi works so well, unlike many busy hotels. The location of the hotel is also optimal--and is a terrific place for a conference. I will definitely be back."

The location is awesome, you’re a 15 Minute Über ride from everything or if you like to walk it’s doable. The decor has a classy vintage feel, it looks like a modern day castle. The gardens are so beautiful and well kept. My favorite part was the hammock cove. They have live jazz on the patio some nights and the pool is awesome. The deepest it goes is 3’6” so it’s good for kids. There is a kids pool, hot tub and a decently sized work gym. The rooms are old but spacious and the bathrooms are tiny!

Location was great for our personal needs but is a few miles from the mall, White House, Smithsonian, etc. It is right next to Rock Creek Park and in a nice area. Metro stop is near by although we used Uber. Always got a ride in under 5 min. Hotel is an historic building and has a grand lobby. Very large hotel but well laid out. Our room was large and had two queen beds. Nice walk in closet and a separate vanity area outside bathroom. Room and bathroom could IMO use a refresh/ update. Bed, pillows, bedding ok but not as nice as Hilton or Westin. Pool area great and very refreshing given very hot summer weather. Outdoor pool is a great feature of this property. Bar was fine. Didn’t eat at the restaurant. A variety of casual restaurants within a few blocks. Hotel had a coffee kiosk with great cold brewed coffee among many other choices. Overall, a very nice stay and a good value given DC hotel prices. I’d recommend it and think it could really be top flight if they refresh the rooms and improve the bedding.This a luxury hotel through and through. The fact that we found it on Groupon only means we could afford to stay here. There are beautiful architectural details throughout the lobby. The hotel offers excellent service from the moment you arrive and while you're on the property. It was a nice way to start or end our day with the fruit infused water near the entrance. Each day had a new flavor. The pineapple was my favorite. The pool is popular and has comfortable lounge chairs. Rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated. A small beverage fridge is in the room. Look for it in the cabinet with the television. We got coffee and tea at Morsels, a grab and go place just of the lobby. The hotel also has a bar and a sit down restaurant. One of my traveling companions enjoyed a drink at the bar. The hotel is a nice 10 to 15 minute walk to the zoo. There are many restaurants within a 5 minute walk. We used Uber to go from the hotel to museums. A metro stop is about a 3 to 5 minute walk from the hotel. Cars are valet parked upon arrival. Overall, this hotel lived up to the Omni reputation. When we return to DC this will be the hotel where we stay."

Room and bathroom were among the largest ever stayed in for a king-sized room! Old-style touches like glass doorknobs, high ceilings, and curved bay windows made room unique. 24-hour gym/heated outdoor pool amenities were really nice to have on site, given a few other hotels in the area didn't have pools. Beautiful and well-kept grounds and sitting areas on the backside of the hotel. Hotel staff very professional and polite. I enjoyed daily visits with Herman at the concierge desk, who always asked how my day had been, what my evening plans were, and gave me great suggestions for food and/or entertainment nearby. He remembered my first and last name by only my 2nd day there, and always greeted me with a warm smile. He truly added to the level of satisfaction I had during my stay, so make sure to seek him out! The downside was housekeeping. The daily newspaper at your doorstep, as well as coffee/tea and toiletry replenishment was inconsistent and required me calling down every evening to to get whatever was missing.A small fridge was in the room (for beverages or leftovers), but no freezer. Quick access to a CVS (open until 11pm) across the street, along with restaurants, liquor store, Dunkin' Donuts, and small convenience store. A longer 15-20 min. walk (with beautiful tree-lined streets and brownstone housing) brought you to another area of town with more options for eating and entertainment. And about 10-mins. up the road brought you to the Zoo which was free of charge."

The room was fairly big and the walk-in closet was the biggest I’ve seen. It’s a historical hotel that still has the original charm. It’s in a great location to restaurants and a CVS. Just over the bridge is an area called Adams Morgan also with many restaurants to choose from. The conference rooms could use some updating with the carpeting and chairs. It had mildew sewer types of smells in the Palladian and Diplomat rooms. The Regency room was well kept. The staff was great and kept everything well stocked. The housekeeping staff always smiled and greeted me. The conference may be held there again next year which is a great choice!

The bed was comfortable and linens were plush, full closet, nice bathroom—though extra counter space would’ve been appreciated. The hotel was well suited to handle convention, but there was only one true restaurant forcing many into the Marriott across the street for lunch. Fortunately just a block away is an area of at least 10 restaurants featuring American, Italian, Indian, and Mediterranean foods. There is also a CVS pharmacy for basic needs. Just a two block walk to the Metro. The pool area was lovely and I used both the pool and the hot tub. Staff was friendly and there were ample folks getting us cabs.

Since then I've stayed at dozens of other DC hotels, but every time I go back to the Shoreham -- including last week, for a conference -- I still love the old place. It's an Omni now and is no longer quite a five star luxury hotel, but it still has a lovely location and a certain grandeur and scale that makes it a special place to stay. Rooms are large and very comfortable (get a south facing room overlooking the gardens), the lobby is still imposing, and the grounds are beautiful. Service was also impeccable. There were hundreds of people at the hotel when I was there, but everything ran very efficiently, room service was always fast, and the staff were kind and courteous. If you like streamlined boutique hotels or need the opulence of a Ritz-Carlton, this probably won't be for you. But there's still something enchanting about walking into the Shoreham, and I always feel good after I've stayed there. Oh yes: the outdoor pool is really nice too."

All bottled drinks (Coke, water, juice, etc.) is $3.49 per bottle. Go to the CVS across the street. You're welcome.- Difficult to navigate once inside the hotel. Lots of twists and turns. Not necessarily a con, just be prepared.- Valet parking is $50/night. No self parking. No other options. Do your homework before hand, park elsewhere, and metro in if you're budget conscious.- Holds an incidentals fee on your credit card when you check in - Again, if you're budget conscious be prepared to have $100-$200 of your funds held during your stay and credited back after you check outOverall, even though I enjoyed our stay and loved the location, for the price I would stay elsewhere in the future. Our stay was purchased through Groupon April 6-8 for $345. I would've found the stay just fine if they had included WiFi, rooms weren't in shambles, and breakfast/things in general were more reasonably priced.Also, we reserved a ""Premiere View Room."" What did we get? A first floor room with a view of the HVAC system. We didn't ask to move or request to be changed because our room was clean and it was 11:00 at night.

Valet is expensive but ours was included with the Zoo package we purchased. I will talk more about that in a bit.The lobby was gorgeous, felt like you took a step back in time. This was opened in 1930, and you could feel the grandeur of that time period. If the walls could talk, there is so much history here. Just stunning Our room and bathroom were small, which I expected of an old hotel. The decor is dated, but I thought that is what brought charm to the place. I recommend a room with a balcony that faces the gardens. We were on the 8th floor balcony garden view and could see the Washington monument. It was so beautiful to see downtown lights at night.On our first night they left a large cookie and milk for my daughter. Nice touch :)Housekeeping was spectacular, every staff member we came across had a smile and was helpful. The staff made us feel like VIP.We ate the buffet breakfast as it came with our package.

The beds are super comfortable and perfect for a family. The room is more than exceptional, Bathrooms are clean, there are no bugs, and the shower is amazing (my best shower I have ever had possibly in my life). The service is excellent and the people are very generous and nice. The food is great but overpriced for the quality of the food however we were comfortable paying for it because of the atmosphere and the luxury of the dining hall. Also, the food options are not very appealing to vegans/vegetarians. My mom who is a vegan had ordered a salad that had no detail(according to the menu) that there was cheese on it. But when it got served, there was cheese as it was not provided in the description of the salad. No hate though! It is just something that Omni should consider (assuming that they read this). If you are vegan, I recommend that you go to the Open City restaurant (and yes, it is close by just across the street). Another problem we struggled with at the beginning, was our dogs. They are allowed but you have to be with them at all times unless they are well behaved and do not bark. This would be a problem because there are monuments and museums that you are not permitted to bring your pets in and keep in mind, that you cannot dine with your pet(s) either. Also, your pets cannot be above 25 lbs to stay in the hotel. On top of that, they can only be cats or dogs (nothing exotic). Although there is a beautiful garden that you can walk your dogs at and you cannot blame the hotel for the pet policy because a lot of hotels don’t allow pets at all. And the staff was nice with the pets. Also in case you were wondering, the closest metro is Woodley park zoo metro station which is only about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. If you need additional information on where to go, you can ask the concierge. Now that we have explained some of the problems, we move on to the features of this hotel. The hotel has a heated, clean, and big pool that you can chill with your friends (despite hot or cool weather). Also they have a awesome fitness and workout center, but you have to be at least 13 to go to the fitness center.Even if your 13 (like me) you must have a parent/guardian to use the equipment. For the pool, you can go by yourself if you are 15 or over but any age below has to have a parent or guardian.There is also a sauna and a spa which people would like. There was also a feature that really surprised me. As I was exploring the hotel, the 8th floor has a room that says “The Ghost Suite”. It’s really cool! I even took a picture next to it. Apparently, two people died in there and many people have complained about moving things and other paranormal activity. You cannot stay in that particular room anymore (the room number is 870). It has two bedrooms and many other features that no other room had. If you want to learn more, google “Omni Shoreham Ghost Suite 870”. Another aspect that other hotels don’t have is the outdoor fire pits in the beautiful backyard that you can chill at with your friends and family. To conclude our vacation, it was great and I recommend that you should stay in the Omni Shoreham Hotel. Also, the chandeliers and everything else are beautiful (also it has throwback to the grandeur of the 1900s). Anyways, our family had a great time thanks to Omni Shoreham."

The elevators are really small, charming but people must have been much smaller in 1930. The rooms are huge but feel sterile. The bathrooms are basic with small white tubs. The moldings are real wood but have been repeatedly repainted without being sanded. My door battery went out during my stay. Maintenance was efficient as was all of the services. People were absolutely wonderful making an extra effort to help. The marketing pictures are just marketing making me somewhat disappointed in the actual hotel. Others in my group loved the old hotel. It just was not for me, but the lobby is impressive."

We were there only 3 short nights and out sightseeing so we did not get to eat in any of the restaurants in the hotel.

Arrival was understandably chaotic, but they were not equipped to handle the influx - they did not have enough luggage carts, we were told it we would need to wait 15-20 minutes out front. When a woman rudely took our long-awaited cart out of my hands, JAMISON, one of the bell hops with a wonderful demeanor, compassion and customer service arrived and made all things right. Jamison was outstanding!Once inside, DAVID at the front desk stole our hearts with his doting on our bday girl - so much so that she offered him one of her roses which he tucked in his lapel. He took care of all of our needs and made that 7-year old feel very special! David even sent her a sweet birthday surprise up to our room that night. David and Jamison will be what I choose to remember about our stay.Our room was fine, with just minor complaints, like closet light not working, dead bugs in the shower which we quickly washed down the drain, and a toilet that didn't flush well. We got overpriced food from room service that was mediocre twice, ate off-site after that. The Beatles and historic memorabilia was fun, and the location is convenient. The lobby and flowers inside were beautiful. I imagine the outside grounds and pool are nice in the warmer months.I was very glad we did not bring the car in as the only parking offered was valet at $50/day!"

This hotel is truly beautiful. The ballrooms in the west side are grand and the standard rooms are very spacious! I'm talking walk in closer, robe in room for use, a dressing room I guess is what you'd call it, clean bathroom, comfy beds, and a space large enough I could,do a cartwheel if I wanted to in the main bedroom. We also could see the top of the national monument from our room. Now if you go,in,summer they have a decent sized pool out back and I beleive I saw 2 jacuzzis. Aside from this there is a beautiful restaurant called, Roberts and a coffee shop and gift shop in the hotel. Another nice thing about the hotel if you like history or being somewhere someone famous had is that the omnishoreham has had plenty of famous people visit such ad the beetles, Regan, etc. The only reason I cannot give this beautiful hotel 5 stars is because we had dirty towels in our room which I called to get new ones that we waited 30 minutes for and never arrived. I will say that someone did make an attempt at some point after that as there was a message about it on our machine and yes its nye and I partied it up till 2am too, but im respectful enough to keep quite in the halls of,the rooms which mine was on the 5th floor. Our neighbors across the hall,decided to continue to,party in the hall an additional 30 mins cursing and yelling then took it into there room with music and the same noise. Being new years I waited but these walls,must be made of,paper because it was loud and clear with the occasional door open and slam shut for the party. At 4 am I was done I couldn't sleep at all. I,called conceierge desk who said they would call security. Guess who never showed up? Security. 5am they finally got quite. So yes awesome hotel, but the hotel is only as good as the staff you employee to represent it. It was disheartening to be told the halls would be quite and enforced and then have that not happen."

Overall, the hotel was great and I fully intend to return here the next time that I come to town. My stay was great, but... well, let's just go step by step.Location:The location is great. No, the Omni Shoreham is not in downtown DC or right off DuPont Circle, but it is a block and a half from the subway. As a NYer, this is fundamental. The immediate neighborhood has good places for brunch and drinks and dinner. It's a short walk to Adams Morgan. It's a longer walk to DuPont Circle, or just take the subway one stop. Frankly, not being in the middle of the bustle is a plus as far as I'm concerned. This is a posh hotel, not a trendy one, and the Omni Shoreham all about having a negroni with Duke Ellington, not a having a Red Bull and vodka with Miley Cyrus.Amenities:Since the place is as luxurious as it is, there are a lot of amenities. But they aren't free. Having a valet park your car in the garage is about $30 a day. Using the internet is $10 per day. There is a fridge in the room, but that bottle of water in the fridge isn't complimentary. So hit the 7-Eleven for a six pack of Sprite before you arrive. Room service, if you're a room service person, is 24 hours. The bar is open to a decent hour (1am I think), so if you get back from dinner and want to relax with a beer, you can. The hotel is very dog friendly. Many hotels are anti-dog, and this can be a real hindrance to traveling with pets. The Omni Shoreham should be on your list if you have a dog.Lobby: The hotel is very swank. The lobby is giant and posh and you feel like a millionaire or a celebrity just by walking in the door. There's a bar and restaurant and coffee spot all right there, should you need it. The bar is like a cigar lounge without the cigars. Dark leather and dark woods. There's a jeweler on the first floor in case you need to buy your wife an expensive gift for some reason. Rooms: For the record, this hotel, which I think is either a landmark or on the register of national historic sites or both, is massive. There's an East Wing and a West Wing, and hundreds of rooms. DC doesn't allow buildings over eight or nine stories, so getting from point A to point B inside the hotel can mean a loooong walk. The rooms are not large, thought they are not small. I did not stay in a suite, so do not think that when I say ""luxury"" I mean that the rooms are small apartments. They're rooms, but the room was very comfortable. The bed was perfect. My room had a balcony. The bathroom was nice and the water pressure was excellent. However, I traveled with my parents and the had the room across the hall. They had issues with the water not getting hot. They had issues with the windows leaking and blowing cold air into the room and causing the ghostly noises that would cause Scooby Doo's teeth to chatter (does that reference date me?). So the rooms are in need of a bit renovation. The carpeting is old, the window panes are old, the seals need to be replaced in spots. The floor under the carpets are warped by time and need renovation. Still, I liked my room and I'd come back.I genuinely enjoyed being here. I love old hotels. I prefer them to the stale modern stuff that big chains cookie cutter out by the hundreds. I wish that the internet was free, and frankly, it seems like such a petty BS thing for Omni to nickle and dime patrons out of. I'd sooner buy a $15 cocktail than pay $10 for wifi. Parking is pricey and I found a spot to park a few blocks away for $0. But the experience as a whole was lovely. I recommend it."

When we wanted a quick getaway, we decided to head back to DC. This was our 4th stay in 3 years and the 3rd trip to the Omni. Our last visit was not as special and I was very disappointed - but the Omni, especially Tia, went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Yes, the hotel is older, yes, it is a little dated - I would love to see the Omni Corp but some real money into this hotel but overall, it is beautiful. The service is always first rate - always. From valet to doorman to check-in, etc., they know customer service. The beds - amazing. The most comfortable anywhere. We had a beautiful room this time around and we were very happy. You can't beat the location - there are so many options for food, if you don't want to eat at the hotel, Starbucks, Dunkin,... all just a short walk away. We had dinner at one of our favorites, the Woodley Cafe, and then walked up to the National Zoo to check out the Zoo lights - I love being close enough to walk to all that. You are not near the mall or the White House or any of that, but it's a short metro ride away It was a nice treat to be there with all the Christmas trees up and decorated for the auction!! We've stayed at two Omni's and plan to check out the Amelia Island one next. Thank you for the wonderful trip back and all your thoughtfulness!!"

I love the old places and this one is beautiful with huge rooms. The location is decent with restaurants and coffee shops an easy walk away. Metro isn't too far unless you have mobility issues and only 2 or 3 stops (depending on where you are going) gets you to the heart of DC. My room. however, was in need of a re-fresh. It met some of my needs (shower was strong enough, personal care items really lovely) but failed in other respects, such as you have to pay for wifi and I had trouble finding sufficient and easy to reach electrical outlets. I read another review complaining about the prices of soft drinks, etc. This is true but there's a CVS a short walk away where one can stock up on water and drinks much cheaper. So, it was a fine stay, just not that special."

Upon arrival I waited 20 minutes to check in because they had one attendant at the desk with 3 others ahead of me. I was given a room with the designation W-137. It did not exist. After 20 minutes of looking, I returned to the desk where the attendant confirmed it was on the East Wing, not the West Wing. When I entered the room I went to the window and found a view of a roof with dozens of cigarette buds and empty cigarette boxes. As I turned the A/C on, the noise it made woke me up every time it turned on through the night. The following morning I spoke with the hotel manager whose name was Julian Taylor. He promised to have a room for me later in the day. I checked out on the 9th and never received the call from him or anybody else. Through my stay I used the bathroom by the conference ballroom 3 times over the 3 days and every time I went to dry my hands, the paper towel dispenser was out of paper and had to literally go to a toilet stall to use tissue paper. Only one empty towel dispenser in the bathroom. I have visited Washington this year for business and pleasure 10 times this year. I have always enjoyed it very much. This was the first time I ever stayed at the Omni Shoreham. It will be the last time I ever will. I typically stay at Capital Hill and the George, Washington Court, Liaison and Grand Hyatt have always been wonderful. This hotel should be shut down."

The lobby and grounds are spectacular and full of interesting history. You have choices between so many wonderful places to sit and relax or enjoy a drink and conversation, both inside the lobby and out on the grounds (although be aware that drinks at the bar are not cheap). Honestly, it was very surprising, given how many guests must be staying at the hotel on any given night, how easy it was to find a quiet place to sit down. The gardens in the back, in stark contrast to the front of the hotel, are filled with grass and a canopy of trees and you feel like you are in a green oasis right in the middle of the big city. It is true that there is a rat running around the back patio and ground. I didn't see him inside the hotel, but he was definitely out there as we saw him multiple times during our two night stay. I even got a picture of the one we saw but I am not going to post it here because in my opinion, big cities have rats. They just do and so, that being said, I can get over a rat being outside in DC as I've seen many rats outside in many big cities. It would be like complaining about bugs outside in tropics. Now, if there were one in my room, that would be a whole different story.The service was notably friendly and helpful during every encounter I had. The woman who checked us in, was nice and helpful. They do seem to have a shortage of engineers on staff as we called up to get one of the outside fire tables turned on and were informed that there was just one guy on duty for all the rooms. Made sense that our fire pit wouldn't be a priority over other issues, but it definitely seems like a staffing problem. When he did get there, as overworked as he must be, he was very helpful and friendly. We used the big pool both nights and the people managing entry there were also nice. We were happy that the pool was still open in October. I wouldn't say the water was tropical temps or anything, but it was certainly heated and comfortable enough to be in at night. The biggest thing I'm torn about is that the rooms are just not very nice and could be cleaner. We were given an odd one - Room 490 West. We needed a roll-away bed for my son and so I definitely think that we got this odd room because of that and, in that regard, the room was perfect for the situation. There was more than enough room for the extra bed in that the room had enough empty space for a decent sized dance floor if we'd wanted one in addition to a large closet (where that roll-away could have fit actually) and an additional large dressing room with a mirror just outside the miniature bathroom. And when I say miniature, I'm not joking. There was truly not even enough room to turn around and, certainly no where to put any of your stuff. The space could be utilized much better. I know that historically the bathrooms aren't a big focal point of a hotel room, but this one was outrageously small. Nearly unusable.Just a few more notes:I know a lot of people have complained about the parking costs. I've been to many hotels where the overnight parking is upwards of $50. I do think, however, that they do need some short term parking for a more reasonable cost. I do recognize that parking is at a premium in DC. My husband's sister lives in the DC area and wanted to come say hello to us and have a drink. She stayed for less than an hour and had taken the train in to see us. If she had driven, there would have been no where to park at the hotel at all, even for that short visit without a hefty fee. There isn't even an area in which to leave your car while you take your bags up to your room.The wings of this hotel are very, very long. So, you can be a very good distance away from the elevators which might be good for some, to avoid the noise, but it could be quite a haul for others as it certainly adds to your ""commute"" to the lobby. The location of this hotel is great. Very accessible to anywhere you want to go. And right down the street from many shops and restaurants. And, a cab to Reagan airport was only $20 or $25 which I think is very reasonable. Elevator traffic can be pretty crazy at different times during the day so you have to be patient. I'm stuck on the rating for this hotel. I know it is billed as a luxury hotel, but the condition of the rooms, at least the one we were in, wouldn't at all fit a luxury category in my opinion. The room was so dated and the bathroom was almost useless, but they did serve their purpose. Nothing had that ""meticulously clean"" feeling although most of it was just fine. Our beds were actually quite comfortable. I heard them talking about renovations, but our room clearly had not been renovated and maybe renovations were limited to the outside. So I'm going to have to go with Average. The location was great and everyone treated us with great kindness. The hotel and grounds were beautiful, but the rooms aren't at that same level."

The washroom was big and plenty of towels were provided. AC was not too noisy, however, It was not the quietest one as well. At the back of the hotel were the garden and the outdoor pool with a pool bar. The only thing that I was not happy about was parking. The parking at the hotel was valet parking for $50/night which I found very expensive.

Upgraded myself by reserving one of the suites. Boy was that as mistake as it meant more filthy carpet to walk on. Literally every piece of furniture in the room was filthy. The bathroom is so cramped you can't move around in any possible way unless the door is open. Hot water was off one morning for four hours so no shower. They also did not give me my scheduled wake-up call one of the mornings. The worst part was found pulling down the sheets my fist night to find a nice fresh blood stain on them (in the pic). Do not book this terrible dilapidated hotel.

The hotel is beautiful and grand. It's a half a block from the metro red line. It is also very close to various restaurants on Connecticut Street: Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Mediterranean, American... There is also a CVS.The hotel has beautiful manicured grounds. There is a large back patio with various seating areas with firepits. The pool area is beautiful. It has many chairs in both sunny and shady areas. There are umbrellas throughout. There's even a small restaurant onsite from which to order your food and drinks while you're launching. Our room was quite large. It had a king size bed with a seating bench in front of it. There was also a desk and a separate seating area. The fridge and coffee makers are neatly tucked away inside the large dresser that the tv sits on. There was a walk-in closet with a full size ironing board, safe, extra pillow and blanket. There were also a pair of robes that were so soft. The bathroom was equipped with many towels. The air conditioning went as low as my husband likes to set it at.The hotel has a main restaurant, but there is also a small coffee shop where you can grab sandwiches, granola bars, etc. This is very convenient if you feel like having a quick snack without stepping away from the hotel. We made our short walk to CVS for our snacks though. The lobby has several grouped seating areas which are great for reading and winding down. I was able to use one of these to visit with a friend that came by the hotel to catch up. This worked out really well. Overall we had a fantastic time at this hotel."

Traditional uniformed doormen and bellmen keep the 1930s-era feel, while a wide open lobby with a spectacular staircase into Robert's, A Restaurant lets lots of light in through the south-facing windows. Giant meeting rooms for business meetings make it a great place for an industry conference, which is the occasion for this stay. From the Regency Ballroom for plenary sessions, to the Palladian and Diplomat Rooms for breakout sessions, there are many small, medium, and large rooms for over 1500 attendees and exhibitors to comfortably move around, with proper planning and logistics.The sleeping rooms are adequate, although the fact that the whole west side of the building was built in the early- to mid-twentieth century is evident and there is sometimes a faint musty odor in the hallways. We had an issue with the toilet and ended up calling maintenance twice, with the second (emergency) repair coming late at night.There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance with a variety of international fare and national brands to choose from. We did an online order at Eddie's (Chinese take out) and I was able to walk across the street, pick up the order, and be back to the room in less than 15 minutes total.I recommend Omni Shoreham for industry meetings, large social reunions, or meetings requiring multiple rooms. The convenience of staying in the hotel proper is offset by the age of the rooms, although there are modern conveniences inside, such as a coffee maker, mini fridge, iron & ironing board, hair dryer, and multiple power outlets. Hope this is helpful to you."

After a 20 minute walk back (the location is not desirable), I waited for the slow elevators to walk to my room only to discover my keys were deactivated. The house phone on the 8th floor at the elevator is in multiple pieces so I again waited for the elevator to go back to the front desk where I was told, as a top tier status member, that I would have to wait in line or wait outside my room for security to show up. Since I already waited in line to check in the day before, I waited for security at my room door for 10 minutes- they never showed and I had to convince housekeeping staff to let me into my own room.You can't order delivery food to this hotel and have it brought to your room, even though the Omni is Charlottesville didn't have this policy. The result? My food was delivered at 815, left at the concierge desk. I finally went downstairs after being transferred from operator to front desk to bell stand to concierge who never answered. I got dressed and went and stood at the desk for 10 minutes and no one ever showed up. I called from my room and asked to speak to the manager on duty to explain my frustrations. He/she was ""out of the room"" and I finally received a call from concierge again who felt I needed to come back down to get my food and I did not agree. My food was finally brought to me 25 minutes after it was delivered yet it was spun as if it were my fault. Someone will bring me my food, I grunted. ""Well, the bell stand is really busy, I tried to call you but you didn't answer."" Nice customer service retort.I never leave negative feedback on a property before I've checked out but since the ""visible"" staff doesn't seem to care maybe the manager will make time to listen now. The loyalty ambassador and housekeeper who was running to try to get me into my room were both amazing. The rest - absolutely awfulThe jotel is near downtown and lots of restaurant beaside the hotel, Nando's was our favorite just beside omni shoreham hotel. We had fun at the crew club, with my gay friend and it was really a taxi cab away from the hotel...."

There was free wifi in the lobby so if you did need it, it was accessible. The hotel isn't in the centre of Washington but easily to get to. There is a metro station a 2 minute walk away where you can get on the red line. This will take you into the centre of DC. If you wanted to, you could walk the distance but may take a while.

The location is near the red line train and several nice family-friendly restaurants. The elevators were annoyingly slow and backed up for 10-15 minute waits at peak morning and afternoon times.

Unfortunately it has one of the worst customer services I have ever seen in my life. My stay here in Washington D.C. here is very limited. I am staying here for two nights total. I wanted to go see some stuff last night but upon arrival my check in was horrible. I went to my room to discover the toilet was dirty. It looked like someone went number two and had smears all over it. My wife called the front desk to ask if someone could clean it real quick before we left the room to go out. No one came. Over an hour went by and then I had to call another three times at least. Now we are at an hour and forty minutes before the maid actually came. Once the maid came she was being so rude to my wife. She even closed the door and did god knows what to our things that were in there. We had to toss our mouth wash bottles because who closes a door in the bathroom. She also started using her cell phone to talk to someone in another language in the bathroom. This is very unprofessional and I asked for her to be removed from my room immediately. The director of the front office did end up upgrading our room to one that was nicer than the one we had but this still doesn't fix what happened to us. Treating your customers like this is a shame. I even had to go to the front desk to offer for them to bring down the cleaning supplies and I would clean the toilet my self. I should have went to the CVS around the corner and just cleaned it myself. I would have saved myself the aggravation of dealing with all this. I hope the Omin learns something from all of this. I didn't mind waiting but at some point when I'm checking in and have a small amount of time to spend here it is ridiculous. It pretty much ruined my trip to Washington D.C. here so far.

The staff is excellent, the lobby smells amazing and is quite clean, and the hotel itself has a great atmosphere. My husband and I arrived the week of Christmas. The lobby was beautifully and seasonally decorated, and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly! So now that I have raved about our lobby experience and first impression, now I can get to the details. I honestly would never complain or leave a hotel for the following issues, but I think it's important to point them out for others who may be turned off or to any managers from the hotel looking at customer reviews. Upon entering our room, which was the basic deluxe, I immediately looked at the carpet... IT WAS SPOTLESS! I think you can tell a great deal about a hotel's cleanliness by just looking at the carpet in the rooms. The sheets and towels were soft and white (also spotless). The bed was extremely firm, the bathroom was small but updated, and there was even a walk-in closet. The room was quite spacious and I appreciated the full length mirror on the closet door. There were a few insignificant details that could be addressed in the future. The baseboards were slightly lifted in a corner, the wallpaper was beginning to crack on one portion of a wall, the toilet paper holder was unstable and broken on one end, and one of the privacy curtains was torn. My husband and I dined at the Marquee Lounge downstairs and noticed a curtain was torn there as well. I have no complaints about the food served at this hotel. We brought in food from another restaurant and housekeeping provided us with a microwave so we could heat up our leftovers. Unfortunately, because this building is ""vintage"", we had to set the microwave on the floor in order to plug it in."

I'm not poetic enough. From the start the bellmen & valet are fantastic! They get your luggage to your room before you get there! The lobby is unbelievable. It's so grand & romantic. The hotel was built in 1930 and they play period music throughout the lobby. The staff could not be more accommodating & friendly. The rooms are spacious, the beds are white, fluffy & very soft. We had a walk in closet! We were in room 894. It had a great view of Calvert St and we saw several motorcades with police & secret service. Very cool. The bathroom was exquisite. The hotel bar is really neat. You must have at least 1 drink in the bar. The breakfast and food in general was delicious but highly over priced. Plan on eating at any of the numerous restaurants in the immediate area. We were there 7 nights and I was very sad to leave. The hotel is breathtaking from front to back. There is a gorgeous garden with fountain just off the balcony. You will only be disappointed if you don't stay at the Omni Shoreman Hotel."

They have big ballrooms that handle conferences and big gatherings but it doesn't feel antiseptic like many big hotels do. The gardens are beautifully kept. There was a big Indian wedding being held there - the canopy and chairs and tables outside looked perfect and just as we were checking out we witnessed the wedding party greeting the groom who arrived on a white stallion to Bollywood style music. It was an incredible sight and the Omni Shoreham seemed the perfect venue for such a celebration.

The Omni was the least expensive package, but before I booked it, I went online and consulted this site and another one for reviews. When I pulled the trigger, I figured I had good information about the pros and cons of this property and decided I could live with them. Pros- The first floor of the property and its grounds are nice and well maintained. The service was great, from check in, to the Bell staff, to checkout. The location for our pleasure visit to the monuments and museums was convenient. Cons- the rooms could use updating. The pillows and the mattress were funky. I'm sensitive to smells. The rest of my family was okay. I had to sleep on my back just to keep from inhaling funk and mustiness. When I turned the heat on, the unit emitted some horrific gaseous smell which left me wondering whether the fumes were toxic. I eventually turned it off, just to be safe. My biggest complaint- THE ROACHES!!!!. On the first day, I saw a small ""regular"" roach climbing up the bathroom wall. I killed it and moved on. It's an old hotel, I'll forgive one roach. My husband talked me out of making an issue of it. Yet, I should have known that they don't live alone. The next day, my husband found a Granddaddy Long Legs in our bathroom. We took a picture of it for evidence, but did not mention it. But when I awakened at 4am the next morning for a early morning flight, I turned on the bedside lamp and saw something scurry under the bed and what did I see, one of those ginormous tree roaches that are about 1.5 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. I screamed, jumped out of the bed and flipped on the overhead light. That's when we saw ANOTHER one scurrying by the dresser and ANOTHER one climbing the wall. Needless to say, I was ready to exit that room with a quickness. I was very concerned about whether any had crawled into our luggage and backpacks. I don't have roaches at home and I certainly don't want to get them. I made my husband and kids go through all their bags before we left and again when we got home. I can't begin to tell you how disgusting this was. Everything got washed because there was no way to know whether one had crawled in and laid eggs or babies- however they do what they do. When we complained to the desk staff at checkout, the overnight manager was understanding and in fact said that ""he could not say that this was the first time he's had a guest report such a thing even though he's never seen it for himself."" Really???? If you know you have roaches, GET AN EXTERMINATOR! My resolution would have been to get my two nights comped because who the hell should pay to spend two nights with roaches and spiders, but because we had done the JetBlue package and had not charged anything to the room, he couldn't comp us. He did give us a credit for $100 for the restaurants, but should I come to DC again in the forseeable future, do I really want to eat at a place where I know roaches reside? If they are in the guest rooms, they are in the kitchen. Ewww! Now, I can't say all the rooms have roaches, but stay away from Room 201 and any neighboring rooms just to be safe. Now I'm experiencing a serious case of post traumatic roach disorder. The suitcases we used are in my basement where I hope that should something have caught a ride home, that they are dieing off down there."

All the staff were at the top of their game, friendly and eager to please.We arrived mid-morning not expecting to get into a room and we're very pleasantly surprised to be given a room just as we had requested which enabled us to unpack and have a full day of visiting museums.The room had plenty of closet and drawer space with a comfortable king sized bed.

I have worked conventions many times there but have never been a guest. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and many of the hallway/lobby features show photographs of the hotel's long history of serving the DC area.It's time for an upgrade.The rooms are adequate size, but the features are not modern. There is a lack of outlets to start with, which is problematic for 2016. The bathroom is small and old. There is vitually no counter space, and if you sit on the toilet, your feet are hitting the waste basket. The privacy curtains were worn through. That has nothing to do with the age of the hotel, that is just poor maintenance. The air conditioner is very noisy, event the thermostat when it turns on and off is loud (weird). The most frustrating thing to me, is the poor service. I logged into the internet, and got knocked off shortly thereafter, and couldn't get back on. My thought was to tell someone. I called the operator and she connected me to the front desk. After about 20 rings, I called the operator back, and told her I didn't get an answer, she tried again. 20+ rings again with no answer. I called the operator back, and told her to connect me with the consierge. He picked up after about a dozen rings, I explaned the situation, and he said he would connect me with the front desk manager. I kind of argued that it was pointless, and his salty reply was that is what is was going to do anyway. I was watching tv, the front desk managers phone rang for 15 minutes before I gave up. Unbelievable. There are so many options in DC, I strongly recommend another hotel before you submit to staying at the Omni Shoreham."

Then back to the hotel for lunch by the pool, some sun and a siesta. There's a great spa for a facial or Swedish massage too.The $25 brunch buffet with waffle and omelet station has my vote although our room service menu was quite extensive. Complimentry Workout bag was already in my corner room overlooking the pool. There's both a bathtub and separate walkin shower in oversized bathroom and room has a lounging chaise, fridge and coffee service too.The hotel has really reasonable weekend rates and the hammocks in the forest of trees is a special getaway treat."

The rooms are big and classy but slightly dated. They keep the rooms spotless and the beds well made with soft, comfy sheets. The bathrooms have big, plush towels and robes and the water gets hot on demand with great water pressure. They provide a lot more toiletries than other hotels. Down side: the rooms have an odor. Kind of old and moldy. Sinks are very low... I'm 5'7"" and have to bend super low to brush my teeth. The tub doesn't drain well so as you shower it puddles at your feet. And the AC unit is LOUD! The food here is ok. Robert's is a bit pricey but nor bad at all, especially if you don't want to leave the premises. The staff was attentive and provided excellent service!The hotel is close to a lot of restaurants and a market and CVS. It's also incredibly close to the red line on the metro.

We arrived two hours ahead of the hotel's check-in time and the lady at the front desk found us a room and checked us in right away. When I received our room key, my daughter received a drawstring backpack with crayons and an activity book. Later that night she received complimentary room service with a giant chocolate chip cookie and milk. She says she'll never go to another hotel. It made her birthday trip that much more special...and I never mentioned the occasion. That was just a part of their routine service.The hotel is beautiful. Large crystal chandeliers adorn the ceiling and comfy couches and chairs are placed throughout the lobby making it very inviting. Our room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. I thought our bathroom was a little small but it was clean. The hotel grounds are well kept and the gazebo/garden area, just outside the restaurant, is lovely. There's a business center just off the lobby where you can pay to use the Internet or print your boarding passes for free.The hotel is about a five-minute walk from the Woodley Park train station. We used the red, silver and blue trains to navigate our way around town and visit some of the local attractions. The attendants inside the train stations were very helpful and told us which trains to take and on which side of the platform to wait. We eventually realized that the walls on either side of the platform show the upcoming stops on the train route. There are several restaurants to choose from between the hotel and the train station - Japanese, Italian, Indian, Chinese, American and Middle Eastern. There are also McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts across the street from each other in this same area. Both have small seating areas but were clean and the service was fast. There's also a CVS Pharmacy on that same block, which came in handy when I forgot to bring the memory card for my camera.The Smithsonian Nation Zoo is within walking distance from the hotel. It's about a 15-20 minute walk. Wear your sneakers. Once you get to the zoo, there will be a lot more walking. If you have little ones and go in summer, it's probably worth it to just take a taxi to the zoo entrance. There's a Starbucks and a Seven-Eleven across the street from the zoo entrance. I went to the zoo at 5:30pm trying to avoid the heat of the day. It was still open but most of the concession stands were already closed...hence my mention of the Starbucks and Seven Eleven. We had a great time in D.C., and if my daughter has anything to say about it, we'll be repeat guests at the Omni Shoreham."

Roosevelt to the Beatles. The hotel decor has been well maintained over the years and the decor is second to none for a hotel of its time. The lobby, halls and rooms are very stately and roomy. The outdoor pool is larger then most DC hotels that even have an outdoor pool. Parking is valet only for $49 as street parking is limited to two hours max and you will be towed. This Omni is walking distance to the DC zoo, many restaurants and bars and Rockaway Park which is where we went on a lengthy exploring walk and run on their famous trail. The staff this weekend were super friendly and the Concierge provided us the local map with the walking trail highlighted. The hotel offers four locations to eat and drink including Roberts which offers buffet and nightly dining. There is a Starbucks and bar lounge by the pool as well as in the lobby entrance. The best part is that during off peak season the rates are so reasonable you might think the website is wrong but it's not. Check it out the next time you're in DC."

Amazing views!,"My wife and I visited this hotel for 2 nights and absolutely loved it. I will start with the check in process, it was quick and easy. They only offer valet parking for $40 per night or you will have to find your own parking somewhere along the street. I was able to find parking along the street about 4 blocks away. The lobby area is decorated with a lot of antique chandeliers and has some nice sofas to sit on if you want to hang out. The entire lobby area is like a history lesson about the hotel. It was built back in 1930 and has hosted many historic events and presidential inaugural balls. There is also a bar in the lobby and small shops that are open during the day. Now to the room, the room was super spacious and very comfortable. The water pressure in the shower was very strong which I love. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and we were able to get a great nights sleep. We worked out in the gym which has some cardio equipment and some circuit machines. The pool is decent size with plenty of pool chairs and lounge chairs. The whirlpool was nice and hot and had some decent jets for a good massage. Breakfast is served inside the lobby restaurant called Roberts, there is also no continental breakfast, so you must order from the menu for individual items or purchase the buffet breakfast. We had the buffet breakfast and it was very good. Behind the restaurant is a garden area with fountains, a grassy area, and some hammocks. Overall this hotel is outstanding and we will definitely be returning."

I even signed up for Omni Select Guest to ensure some better customer service. I was impressed with exterior and the beautiful lobby, but that was where it ended. Guest Select obviously means very little. I wanted to ask if there was anything I needed to know about my stay, but the reception person was not forthcoming. For instance, reception should let you know about any extra amenities like location of the pool area or that I could request a different newspaper from the one offered, which was USA TODAY. The trip from the elevator to our room took at least 7 minutes. My sister, who travelled with me is handicapped. I decided not to change the room because we were informed that the hotel was fully booked. We got charged $20 more for our room because my 16 year-old daughter was also with us, but there was only enough towels and toiletries for ONE person!!Insult to injury the pillows were feathers. We are allergic and promptly called the front desk to request that poly filled pillows be brought up. At that time, someone should have told us that the coverlet was also down. We found this out on the last night of our stay from a kind and conscientious room service woman. The first person from service only came up with 2 pillows for 3 people. He promptly told us that he was going off duty and would have to wait.Another insult was the so-called mini fridge which was not cold but came with the room. We were forced to rent a real fridge for an extra $10 per day! We brought our own garbage bags to put in our refuse, only to find that room service left it behind in an otherwise clean room.The only bright spots were Mr. George, one of the bellman and Samia, the concierge. Both were excellent. In fact, the hotel had ran out of DC circulator maps. Samia went out to the nearest circulator stop, on her way out from work and brought some back, leaving one under our door!! Such excellent service deserves reward that is why I bumped up the rating from poor, which was deserved to average. As for staying at another Omni, I will hesitate."

The previous guests stripped the beds, rearranged all the furniture in the room, and even draped the smoke detector with a wet towel. The absolute worst thing was the blood looking stain on the mattress and a dripping and smear of blood like substance in the bathtub. I realize that the hotel has no control over what guests do but the cleaning of the room was not completed. They said they would send house keeping right up. I did inquire about switching rooms but there were none available at the time and they said they might have something later in the evening. I went out to my work dinner and after when I inquired about another rooms availability they said they weren't able to move me until the next day and offered me a free breakfast which I turned down since the company event had all meals provided. When I went back up I took these pictures and the towel was still on the smoke detector, the blood stain was still on the mattress, but the bed was made covering it. When I went down for a third time and showed these pictures they said they could move me for the night but would have to move me again the next day. I agreed since all I wanted was a clean bed to sleep on. The second room had two beds but there was some sort of dirt on the one bed. I took a chance, since I had no other choice and slept on the second bed. Finally I was moved the next day to a room that was clean and nice. I am not one to write reviews that are negative or complain but I was shocked at not only the situation but how it was handled and I will not be staying here again. I would have expected more from such a well know hotel and with all of its history. I stay at a lot of hotels and this is the first time I have had a experience that is even worth mentioning that is negative. These pictures were taken in room 314. Proceed with caution."

Rooms are nice and comfy, and there is a mini fridge in the room (not stocked, but there are stores nearby). The pool area is very nice, but it is not really set up with much to do for kids. Still, it's very nice. If you stay here, you'll see parts of the city that aren't in the touristy areas, which to me is its charm. You can easily make it to the heart of the capital and see everything you want, and also see areas like Adams Morgan and Georgetown, which aren't far away. One draw back - the wifi is not complimentary unless you are a loyalty program member, and although I tried to sign up, the app did not work so I was not able to get free wifi through the Omni. The conference I attended did have it set up, but if you're expecting that standard amenity, you will be disappointed."

The little shop that sold coffee and snacks was perfect for breakfast. I can't recommend the hotel enough could not find fault with anything. To get around Washington I would recommend sings the metro system. So easy and just minutes from the hotel. Very cheap way to get around.

Having stayed in DC several times before, I usually find lesser expensive options away from DuPont area. This year my trip was covered by the association I was representing and chose to stay at one of the conference hotels being the Omni. It is across the street from the Marriott Wardman which if your conference is large enough, you may be walking back and forth a lot which made this an ideal settling place. My room was well maintained and really the only reasons I didn't leave an excellent review was because my room, although clean and neat, was tired. The trim work was less than pristine and the tub didn't drain well which made my showers more like a shallow bath. The lack of screens in windows that open allowed a few flies in but having the ability to open a hotel window is always nice being that fresh air is at a premium when you are stuck in conference sessions all day. Check-in was a breeze. Staff was courteous. Thanks Onmi!"

The Beatles, Frank Sinatra performed here, and even portions of Pretty Woman was filmed here. The entrance and main floor are astonishing. The restaurant is pricey, but the breakfast is great, but pricey ($26 including tip). The gardens are stunning this time of year (Cherry blossom season). Staff are hard working, elegant and friendly. That was the good news.My room was on the eighth floor (kindly upgraded to two doubles eventhough I was solo). It had wet carpet by one of the beds that may or may not have to do with the puddle coming from my bathroom sink. The bathroom had a dinner plate sized pool of water that I initially chalked up to just splashes from cleaning. I wiped it up, but found it came back, leaking from the base of the sink. Hair in the tub upon arrival and a weird spot of something dark red on the door jam near the toilet :-/(??? blood?)Dressing table lamp is burned by the light bulbs, and the A/C is really noisy. I wear ear plugs anyway to sleep (even at home), but could hear it even with them in.Then, my door lock was running low on batteries, so I got locked out. A kind security guy came to help me in and for safety checked my ID, but then he took it with him when he left. Last night here and I ordered room service (a Ruben sandwich with fries for $25). It was supposed to take 45 min at around 9pm, but only took 20ish. BUT one of the little condiment jars was open and almost EMPTY from someone else's use, while the others were sealed and fresh. (Imagine getting am open and half empty ketchup packet from a drive thru-MINOR and first world problem, but icky and sloppy.The in room fridge is luke warm, and trying to order from the in room movie service causes the Tv to freeze up.Ok so all minor issues individually, but the way they accumulate tells me it's a high level management issue of quality control.Overall, the hotel itself has merit. They just need to go room by room and comb thru the little cracks in the facade, and sloppy bits and bobs."

The wallpaper in my guest room was peeling in multiple areas, and the window frames and doors had been painted over so many times (obviously without being stripped first) that it appears nothing more than shabby improvements. Because of the age of the hotel, I would caution against having a room with a connecting door, as the noise between rooms is obvious - there is little insulation. The room furniture is quite dated and upholstery on the chair in my room was ripped and faded. Window treatments were also dated and in need of replacement, as was the carpet in my room which was stained in multiple areas. I might also add that one morning as I was headed to the elevators, a group of housekeeping staff was in the hallway complaining about another employee using profanity to explain her - certainly not something that was pleasant for a guest to hear.My one largest complaint is the lack of good housekeeping service. There is no excuse for a dirty bathroom, and especially no excuse for mold in showers (see photos attached). My other complaint was the bed; the mattress was old as there were permanent lumps in it from others sleeping there, and the pillows are extremely thin with no head elevation whatsoever; if this is important for other sleepers, I recommend requesting additional pillows for your room.There is some wonderful history attached to this hotel, and I recommend taking a look at the artifacts in the lobby area which includes a handwritten Beatles music set list from when they stayed at the hotel many years ago. The area around the hotel has some wonderful restaurants including New Heights Restaurant two blocks from the hotel on Calvert Street NW.I likely would not return here again; not impressive from a cleanliness standpoint."

The hotel and grounds are simply lovely, especially in the spring. It's less than 5 minute walk to the Metro - maybe 3 minutes, which is great in DC - the whole city is at your feet.My room was spacious with a wonderful view of Rock Creek Park, I had a big walk-in closet and a tiny bathroom as well as a room between the bed & bath that I imagine was perhaps a ladies dressing room at one point? Since it is a historic building everyone's room is not exactly the same size and layout.I got room service once for lunch and another for breakfast, both times it was delicious and the staff was great. I was in and out of my room at odd times due to the conference but they always managed to clean and make it look great while I was away. Bed was absurdly comfy and cushy.The bell staff was efficient and I liked that every time you walked outside and into the hotel someone held open the door for you. I also liked that I checked in before a room was ready (it was around noon) and they called me as soon as the room was available and my key was 'on the wall' I didn't have to wait in line again, very handy.Thank you to concierge Herman for giving us a heads up about the Rihanna concept that was at Verizon Center before we headed out to Jaleo for dinner, definitely a good thing to know before we got there."

I went to reception and explained that I would be there for 10 days, and could we have something nicer, with a view and quieter.They moved us to room 893 (I hope I got that number right!). It was FABULOUS. The room is mammoth, and has a tiny balcony looking over the pool, and has a dressing room and huge walk-in closet. There are fabulous mirrors in this room - I think at least 5! The beds are comfortable, the fridge is empty, so we could load it with our own stuff. The staff usually did a great job (once they were quite late). The door is very old and doesn't fit the frame well, so lots of light poured around the door itself at night. It worried me that it would be really easy to break into the room. I did have an engineer come up and look at it, because the deadbolt didn't fit into the frame and he was able to fix that for me.It's an old, classic hotel. I hope they can find the financing to maintain it - it is full of history and very comfortable. I hope I can return!Thanks for a great stay!"

The bathroom is so small that I hit my head on the pedestal sink when getting off the toilet!! The room was supplied with the usual poor coffee service. I would expect the Omni to be a cut above in this regard, so was disappointed. (Recent stays at Radisson have featured pod coffee in the room) I was also annoyed that I could not get the small refrigerator to work very well - it was more effective to cool bottled water on the bathroom window sill! Finally, watch out for the Parking fees - about $42 a night with tax. These issues not withstanding, it was a large room with comfortable beds in a good location in the Nation's capital."

Also, reception was very prompt and pleasant. We were happy with our room. It was clean and had tons of character. The room was renovated appropriately, but still held the character from the early 1930s-40s. We enjoyed morning coffee from the shop downstairs and also had a decent breakfast in their restaurant. I would recommend maybe checking out other breakfast locations first. I think breakfast/brunch is popular there in walking distance. The evening before we had a cocktail at the bar there. The bar is beautiful and service was great. It seems a popular place for business meetings. The location of this hotel is very convenient. We enjoyed dinner both nights in walking distance and when we went to tour the monuments and museums it was a short cab distance away. It cost about $15 each way. We highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay there again.

That being said, some things need some updating. We booked 2 rooms for 3 nights while our family attended a funeral at Arlington. I expected an elegantly appointed room and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I've stayed in many historical hotels and B&B's and I just expect that little something extra from them, otherwise I would just stick to the Hampton Inn. While the beds were very comfortable, the duvets were too short to cover the sides of the mattress and the decorative pillows needed to be refreshed. I would also suggest adding extra bed pillows, there are only 2 per bed. The room had potential, it just fell short of the luxury feeling for me. My parents room had a strong odor, smelled like mold/mildew. I was going to ask for them to be switched to another room, but my father was there to bury his brother and just didn't want to deal with the hassle of re-packing and moving to another room. We also found some sort of small insects in the bathtubs of both rooms.Pros: It was outside downtown but still convenient to the sites.Check-in was quick and easy, staff was very accommodating.The grounds are very nicely kept, even in December. Nice area to sit and chat, or watch the deer from the wildlife viewing area.Cons: Valet/Bell staff was hit or miss.If you order a drink at the bar stick to the menu, we got a few strange concoctions when ordering old favorites.NO Wi-Fi. If you want to use Internet cafe in the lobby they charge you $10.00 per 15 minutes of use.We had a great concierge named Herman. He made some great recommendations, except for the Memorials tour at night. It was awful. I would really only suggest seeing the Lincoln & Jefferson memorials at night (possibly the WWII memorial). You can not appreciate the Vietnam / Korea memorials at night when it's too dark to see where you are walking much less the names on the wall. The tour is rushed, you practically march/run through each site so there is no time to really look at anything - it's so rushed that we lost 2 people on the tour. Most of the tour felt like a bad taxi ride.Overall I give it a C+. We will be visiting again in the spring, I will most likely chose a different place to stay."

The hotel gives you 2 bottles of complementary bottled water in the mini fridge if you are a select member, which is free to join! Definitely make sure you sign up to be a select member because as a select member you get free wifi. The gift shop is crazy over priced so my husband and I walked the 2 blocks to CVS to get snacks and drinks. The first day we got here we bought 2 sodas and 2 bags of chips and it was $10! The coffee shop in the hotel is great, the coffee is reasonable but everything else is way over priced. My husband got a banana one morning and it was $2 just for the banana! The hotels free WIFI is HORRIBLE! We were able to connect to it but it was really slow and very spotty. If you plan to stay make sure you join the rewards program so you can get the free wifi because it's not worth paying for! The premium is $10 a day or $4.95 a day for select members. We weren't able to stay connected long enough to upload pictures on the free wifi and we didn't want to pay extra and it be crappy as well. The location of the hotel is great! The Metro is about 2 or 3 blocks from the hotel and very convenient for those who don't plan on renting a car. The parking here at the hotel is way overpriced so I recommend using the Metro and getting a cab to places the Metro doesn't go to (the only place the Metro doesn't go is Georgetown). The valet parking for overnight is $41 a night. We didn't rent a car so I don't really know how valet parking is. There are a ton of great restaurants near the hotel and the hotel also has a restaurant and bar. We didn't eat at the restaurant but we did visit the bar and again everything is way overpriced. The bar has several big screen TV's and had different things on that you could watch. The National Zoo is 4 blocks from the hotel and a block from a pick up or stop for The Old Town Trolley tour, the big bus tour and a bus for the Metro. All in all we would definitely stay at the hotel again if we got another good deal on the room rate!"

It's true, the Dining Room (Robert's Restaurant) is an absolute disaster in terms of ""Service"" at Breakfast-time, and we do really wonder why the management has failed to address this issue in all the years we've been coming here? Also, the Elevators can be more than a bit frustrating - but it's hard to see what can be done about that problem.Over the years, we've stayed in a variety of Rooms, and they've generally been quite good (this year's particularly so) - just accept that the size of Bathroom you get at an Omni is quite compact, so be careful you don't knock something over as you manoeuvre, especially when you're not exactly at your brightest in the morning!There's an extremely well-run Bar/Lounge : Hassan is simply superb, and his ""Floor Staff"" of Mimi, Achu & Rahel all demonstrate great customer-service skills - as well as giving you a truly warm welcome when you come back!The ""Reception"" (or, as I think Americans call it, the ""Front Desk"") wasn't the most impressive some years ago, but this time I have to say, I commend the people we dealt with : Kara, who checked us in, was certainly competent & efficient, Mary, who sorted-out a minor problem we had with our in-room safe was not just helpful, but displayed a welcome degree of ""humour"", and Erica, with whom we had a number of interactions, also impressed - thank-you to all of you!This is indeed an extremely busy Hotel, with lots of ""comings & goings"" - the Porters/""Bell-Hops"" we encountered were generally helpful, and we thank them too for making our arrival & departure that bit more tolerable.As you might gather, we hope to come back here again!"

It is a brilliant blend of style, theatrics, and quality here at this hotel. As you walk into the lobby, you're greeted by a fantastic layout that will take you a moment to take it all in. Immediately, you know you're staying in a one of a kind hotel. The ceilings are brimming with light cascading down from magnificent chandeliers. Lounge chairs and tables invite you to take a load off and just simply hangout and relax as the world zips and zooms past you. The surrounding tapestries are fit for an age of decadence that you don't quite see anymore. Pictures of famous guests are in the main corridor welcome you to join their ranks. Folks such as President Harry S. Truman, The Beatles, and Frank Sinatra who coincidentally plays in the lobby. It was pretty amazing. But it doesn't end there.Upon checking in you're greeted by the friendliest set of professionals that I have ever had the pleasure of conversing with. Although, I was checking in earlier than the room was ready. They offered to hold luggage in their back office and call me when the room was ready. At which point, my key will be waiting for me on the board. I came back later that night after a day of exploring DC and sure enough there is was as promised. The gentleman at the bag/coat check had my bag ready and waiting for me. I simply went up to my room.Here's where it gets really fun, as you walk through the corridors, the classic style continues. The carpeting although on the older side was spotless. Interesting items such as the courtesy phone was similar to that of a rotary (see the pic.) Upon approaching your hotel room door, entry is provided by a key card, but just underneath it is the old style keyhole. A subtle well placed upgrade to an old-fashioned lock. Most places remove the keyhole altogether and opt for the electronic lock. From what I can see the dead bolt still worked.The magic doesn't stop there, inside the room is a huge King/California King sized bed. Needless to say, I slept like a baby. The most comfortable sleep I've ever had in a hotel. The bathroom doors did not have a lock on them but they did have an old fashioned keyhole as well and costume jewelry themed door knobs which screamed retro!A few items, you do have to pay for internet service, there are two tiers one 6MB, and the other 3MB worth of bandwidth. The 6MB is $14.95 for a 24-hour period unless you sign up for their loyalty club. I did try to do so but I still was charged the full price for my stay so it came up to about $28. Parking is also about $25 per day, I did not have a car and used Uber/Lyft for my duration, but if you're planning on bringing a car be prepared for that. The location is amazing, it is right on Calvert street in the heart of Woodley Park, a few blocks south of the Zoo. There are plenty of restaurants and things to do in that area and the metro is a block away which will take right into the mix of things in DC. Orange Line to Smithsonian stop and you're golden! I highly recommend staying here, and I will be making more reservations for future stays as well. Omni has become my number 1 for D.C. Book it you'll enjoy it if you like traditional style over modern contempo!"

Located on the outskirts of the city, this hotel is a comfortable blend of of modern, luxurious comfort with historic styling. This is the hotel the Beatles stayed in when they first came to America, and it has had many famous guests, from celebrities such as Frank Sinatra to presidents. Located around the block from both the Metro station (2 stops to downtown Washington) and a number of restaurants with sidewalk seating, the Omni is located in a very comfortable and safe neighborhood. Hailing a taxi was very easy and immediate, as bellmen whistle for one of the cabs always waiting near the entrance. If you want a very peaceful rest, request a room in the back building, which is behind the main complex and in the midst of a quiet, serene wooded setting. I highly recommend the Omni for a great stay."

The lobby was quite beautiful and the hotel has an overall old elegant about it. The staff was quite friendly and very helpful. The rooms, though, we're just okay. I've stayed in rooms as nice/nicer than this one for half the price. Again, I realize it's all about LOCATION. LOCATION, LOCATION.The bathroom was poorly designed. It was quite hard to squeeze through since the door opens so closely to the sink. If definitely would not accommodate more than one person in the bathroom at a time with that layout. Comfy beds. But I was just generally underwhelmed with the room. I would also think at this price, they would offer some type of complementary breakfast."

My shock came in when I open my bathroom door. The room was a great size but the bathroom is extremely small. To the point where it is difficult to even turn around between the tub and sink. No storage in the bathroom to layout items. The frustrating issue is that right outside the bathroom is a space which could have been used for the bathroom to make a beautiful sized bathroom. Barely room to place a toothbrush next to the sink. To top it off the bathroom door does not close, even if you push it with all your might. As well there is a walk-in-closet which is a wasted space due to very poor layout. The room it's self is nice. Nice comfortable beds."

I recommend signing up for their free perks program which enables you to get free Wi-Fi in your room and a free beverage (coffee/juice/soda) delivered every morning. You can also get free nights with nights stayed, however the immediate perks were a better incentive for me to sign up.I stayed here for a work conference, which was also at the hotel. The hotel is in a great location - only about a block to the Metro and I heard many people talk about walking or renting the city's bikes to get to the White House or The Mall, however walking sounded a little long. There were also some good restaurants in the area, however we found it much easier to just use Uber to take a ride to restaurants as fairs were usually around $8 to get from the hotel to Georgetown and 14th street. It was also easy to take the train to the Nat's stadium for a game.The room was large and comfortable, overlooking the front entry to the hotel. It is slightly dated, however still very beautiful. I had a King bedroom and there was a huge amount of space in the room! The hotel has some fun history, with lots of celebrities, presidents, etc. staying there which they hi-light in the lobby. Definitely seems to have a lot of history in the hotel! Note that the hotel was also massive (although it didn't feel like it with the location of my room in the west promenade - so ask for a room in that side of the hotel!) The elevators were also a little slow (especially in the morning).The staff was also great! Whether I ran into one of the housekeepers, spoke with the concierge, or saw another staff member in the hall, everyone gave a smile and said hello! Great job in that aspect!For everything I got, I felt the amount paid ($189/night plus taxes and fees) was very reasonable in this location! I recommend!I was planning a family trip to DC and needed 3 things in the hotel: nice and clean, good location and outdoor pool. This hotel checks off all 3 boxes. I have young daughters and it was DC in August so the pool was perfect at the end of a long hot day touring the sites. The staff was very courteous, food was great, hotel was gorgeous and the room was nice and clean. I would recommend to anyone with a family to stay here and you won't regret it."

Has a lot of character. Everyone on the staff I encounter was friendly. Rooms were clean but you can tell the age of the rooms. Had a little musky smell. Nothing major. Bathroom was waaaay to small. There is not counter. Just a window ledge and top of the toilet to put your toiletries. Wifi speed was slllooowwww. When you can take a walk around the hotel. It's crazy to see the old school ballrooms. Take a little time and read all the plaques on the wall. A lot of history. Parking is outrages. It's valet only. At a rate of $28 per day. I stayed there for 5 days. I think my total was 180 after all the hotel fees. Not including tips for the valet. No you cannot park on the streets or anywhere else for that matter. Save your money and eat out of the hotel. There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance. Don't be afraid to walk for about 15 min up the street. A lot of bars and restaurants. The double decker bus stop is 2 min away and city bus and 10 min away from subway. Also walking distance to the national zoo. The location worked out perfect!!

Everything was so comfortable and easy. The staff was AMAZING! Everyone I came in contact with was so incredibly friendly AND genuinely nice. The food was delicious, presented beautifully and with smooth execution for our very large group for each meal, not just dinner. The meeting rooms were large attractively decorated in the time period of the hotel's age. The grounds are nicely decorated and maintained, very relaxing, with hammocks, rocking chairs and dining tables as well as a fire pit. The pool is so refreshing and large enough for everyone to use in such a huge hotel. The valet car service was super. You text a number from your claim ticket and your car is ready when you show up at the entrance in a few minutes. I loved every minute staying here. This hotel is a wonderful place for a meeting, large and small, special events or just for families sight-seeing DC. It is 2 blocks from the National Zoo and a metro stop. The neighborhood is so tranquil and great for an evening walk or jog with Rock Creek Park in the back for nature. It is a tremendous hotel in size but very cosy with a small hotel feel.

Located 1 minute from the Woodley Park Metro station, or an 8 minute Uber ride to Georgetown and Monuments, the location can't be beat. I used to stay in Dupont circle but will absolutely make this my new DC home away from home. The Woodley Park area of DC is blanketed with some of the oldest and most lush foliage in the city. Just walking the pathways through the park left me dreamy. The surrounding restaurants are yummy and brimming with locals who flock to the area for a break from DC madness. Tia (the hospitality ambassador) made sure that my every need was taken care of. The room attendants, most have been with the property for 10 plus years were gracious and wonderful.

The hotel is really easy to get to, and somewhat close to a lot of attractions. Valet parking is $40+ per night (What do you expect, it's the Omni) but we managed to find plenty of parking nearby for free. The building itself is impressive. In the huge lobby, they have banners featuring all the famous people and events that have stayed or happened at the Omni Shoreham. The room was nice and clean, and pretty spacious, and quiet. The King size bed was really comfortable. We had the breakfast buffet at Robert's Restaurant downstairs near the lobby. It was a little expensive for a buffet with the little selection they had offered. Service was top notch though. I would definitely stay again, just make sure to eat at other establishments.

The room was nice, with an equally nice view. The pool was utilized many times.

The kids also received free milk and cookies in the room - which they were particularly excited about and considered that ""maybe Santa brought them to our room?"" We'd be inclined to recommend the hotel to others (especially families) that were interested in visiting the Zoo. The elevators were quite busy, but we used the stairs occasionally. There were many conferences at the hotel during our stay, so the lobby was almost always full of people in suits.Dining:The servers during breakfast and dinner were very focused on their tasks, but not particularly friendly during their service. Few smiles, and not as attentive as I would expect. The food was very tasty and well prepared, and I did notice the chef walking around at dinner, but he did not happen to come to our table. The waffles and omelettes for breakfast were delicious, as well as the meatloaf at dinner.Nearby/Tips/Recommendations: There's a fantastic ""gin joint"" right up the street from the hotel, with flights of premium gin & tonics. A must-do if you're a G&T fan. Mr Chen's organic Chinese takeout right around the corner was delicious and fresh. Woodley Park Cafe was very gracious and friendly for lunch, and the owner gave the kids free cookies. We ate at Open City twice - once for breakfast and once for dinner - very tasty and recommended. Great selections. Use the ""NoWait"" app on iPhone to make sure you can reserve a table there if you try to go during a busy time."

I was looking for a good hotel with a decent price and I am very happy that I stayed in one of the best hotels in DC.This hotel is 15-20 minutes ride from Reagan Airport by Metro. Blue or Yellow line from Airport to either Gallery place or Metro center and then Red line to Woodley park station. From Woodley park station the hotel is very close and just 3 minutes of walk. Calvert street, the place where hotel is located is beautiful with many nice restaurants around. There are many international restaurants around this place such as Lebanese, Italian, Indian and Chinese.The hotel lobby is elegant and beautiful with chandeliers, granite floors and nice furniture. The lobby is huge and has enough seating areas. Its luxurious and looks beautiful. Hotel staffs are very courteous and helpful. Hotel has a concierge that provides all sightseeing information, and tour details. The lobby extends to a restaurant and then opens into a garden area which is very beautiful. One can sit and enjoy the nature, flowers and the entire area here is quite romantic.The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Becoming Omni member will provide free wi-fi and bottles of water in the room. Membership is free. Toilet is very clean and the toiletries are the best. Each room has a small refrigerator and a sofa. Staying here was a pleasure and I thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful hotel.The best part is it is very close to all the DC attractions and takes 10-15 minutes by metro. Walking from the hotel to Dupont circle provides one a scenic DC view and it is a pleasure.I couldn’t have stayed in a better place for the money that I spent and I highly recommend this hotel to all. Staying here is certainly a memorable experience."

It's a $14-$17 taxi ride from the monuments, but the grounds make it worth it! Never went to the pool, but the grounds are absolutely beautiful! Lots of sitting areas, a fire pit, hammocks - it was like a country inn in the city! The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the area offers many great restaurants within walking distance. Great experience! (PS - if the view from your room matters, check it first. Our room on the first floor had a view of the HVAC equipment, but we only slept there so it didn't matter!)The only complaint can be the lack of intimacy. Service is fine. Rooms very good and spacious. Not the most modern and bathroom is basic. Grounds impeccable. Pool area magnificent Breakfast was varied and tasty with lots of nice touches. The only problem is that it is such a large property with two wings that can only be connected in lobby. Would be nice if the wings had more than two elevators. But as noted, that's nitpicking.Would definitely stay there again."

The suite was sumptous, with complimentary water and good-quality toiletries. If you don't have time to visit a ""proper"" souvenir shop in Washington D.C., the souvenir shop located at the lobby offers items at a reasonable price. You could spend time at the lobby and not be bored. In fact, the lobby was where I spent most of my time because it is the only place that has hassle-free WiFi. Upon checking in, we found out that we'd have to pay $10 a day for WiFi in the rooms. According to the hotel's page, I can also get wifi once I sign up for the ""loyalty program"". I got the email confirmation, but no WiFi. This was really disappointing to me. For such a classy hotel, you'd think WiFi is a given. Why provide strong internet connection at the lobby where anyone could just walk in, and not the rooms which guests pay for? Even though I think this is the only point for improvement, it is equivalent to at least a star. This would make you world-class."

Overall, this property is large, elegant, and historical, with spacious rooms and beautiful views (my room was located on the West Side and I could see the tip of the Washington Monument). If you're light-sensitive, the older, wooden doors of the room are not sealed well, and a significant amount of light streams in from the hallway. During our time at the hotel, the lobby was always busy with with lots of hotel and event guests coming and going. Valet parking seems to clog up with large events at the hotel, as when we arrived on a Saturday evening at 10pm, there were literally 100+ people from an event that just concluded, waiting for their vehicles to be pulled around! I did not find their Front Desk Staff to be welcoming or helpful. I sent three boxes to the hotel and in attempting to retrieve them, a young brunette manager at the Front Desk first told me that they weren't there (I had confirmation they were received & signed for) and then that I wouldn't be able to pick them up because their UPS Store was closed (it was a Sunday). I had to essentially press for her to locate them and she lacked a helpful, guest-centric attitude. Overall, lots of history and unique architectural touches contained within this hotel. However, because of its size, I think some things, such as consistent & personalized service from staff, are lost!"

I was assigned a big room with walk-in closet (which was nice!), and a veranda that looked toward DC and the Washington Monument. As with all Omni Hotels, everything was clean as a whistle, and the staff were uniformly great. But... Beware that it's a big hotel -- the walk from my room to the front door was a good five minutes. (This wasn't a problem for me, and upon check-in, I was asked if I wanted a room by the elevator and I said no.) The whole place -- and certainly the rooms and corridors -- are ready for a refresh. Most importantly, know that The Omni is fair shot away from the central city and monuments/attractions. Luckily, it's a close walk to the Red Line train, but I spent more on taxis and Uber than I'd planned.I'd gladly stay here again. But I might price the Willard or the Hay-Adams first, just for convenience."
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g28970-d84087-Reviews-or4240-Omni_Shoreham_Hotel-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,Omni Shoreham Hotel,"2500 Calvert Street NW, Washington DC, District of Columbia, 20008-2649, United States",38.9226849,-77.0536644,Great Hotel!,"FRILLS REVIEWS (#3) --Background:I stay in a hotel in the DC area once a week. I book these hotels through a hotel discount site. All these hotels are very nice – 3 stars at the minimum. As far as I’m concerned, there are no major differences in any of them. But there are plenty of minor ones – little things that really count. So I’ve decided to start writing reviews based on things I care about.Unless otherwise noted, all hotels have reasonably pleasant staff, basic amenities, an on-site restaurant, reasonably responsive elevators, free internet in the lobby but not in the room, and a workout room with water, towels, free weights, and general equipment (Bosu balls, matts, etc.). I generally don’t use the swimming pool or order room service so they generally won’t be rated.I am a tough grader. I use a 10 point system because I don’t think 5 stars is enough. To get a 10 the hotel would have to be truly outstanding. A 9 is excellent, and an 8 or 7 means I was completely satisfied but there is room for improvement. A 6 is borderline and a 5 means it didn’t meet expectations. From there things go downhill to a 1 which is truly awful. Room reviews will be based on the basic room I was provided. I expect them to be clean, relatively quiet, have a decent television with HD and at least one premium channel (which will be noted). [Does anyone know why none of the local hotels carry the CSN/MASN networks?]. The other things I care about are the shower, the climate control system, and outlet availability. I don’t use the alarm clock so I’ll only note if the staff did not check to make sure the alarm was off before leaving the room.I do not do RANT reviews – if I have an unusual bad experience that I feel was probably random, I’ll either note it in the review, but more likely I’ll just refrain from writing a review that time. If it’s serious enough that I decide to contact the hotel management, I’ll wait to write the review until I receive a response – unresponsiveness is inexcusable and will be reflected in my reviews.REVIEW:7-The problem with many four-star hotels is that they cater to a richer class of people -- people who are willing to pay higher prices for food, internet, etc -- which means fewer 'frills'. This was one such place.Location: Excellent – A short walk to the Woodley Park Metro station. Several restaurants within short walking distance.Restaurant: (Key Bridge Terrace) Below Average – A restaurant and a bar on site and neither one had Happy hour specials – from looking at the menu it would have been difficult to get away for under $20 just for a meal with tax and tip. It didn’t help that it was close to zero degrees out, but that’s not the hotel’s fault.After coming back from dinner I went to the bar to try and see the Capitals game since of course it wasn’t available in my room. They were showing another game on three of the televisions. The man behind the bar said they didn’t get CSN. Fitness Center: Very Good – This is one of the those hotel fitness centers that doubles as a fitness club which means there was a lot of equipment there as well as an attendant. The equipment seemed to be mostly second-generation. Loaner headsets supplied. Television: Very Good – Straight tuning – channel 1 is the hotel channel and then the regular channels start. Good selection of channels [HBO]. The screen was slightly smaller than average.Shower: Average – Standard head 7 feet high. Climate Control: Above Average – Digital Thermostat controlling a heat pump unit.Outlets: Poor – one open outlet next to one side of the bed and one near the desk.Other: This place is huge! It dates back to the 30s which means it’s very stately but it also has its share of drawbacks. The bathroom was one of the smallest I’ve seen, basically a glorified closet. There was no vanity, just one small shelf strategically placed high over the toilet. Along with the usual toiletries, mouthwash was provided – a nice little bonus."

We liked this big hotel, very nice, ""luxury for ordinary people"". You never felt uncomfortable, everybody we met during our stay were friendly and professional. We never had problems with long lines for checking in and out, nor for breakfast. I can imagine there might be problems during conventions or if the hotel is totally booked. We also had a great weekend-rate, I would not like to pay full-price... Interesting information in the lobby concerning the history of the hotel.We especially liked the buffet breakfast but were not impressed by having to pay over USD 40:- a night for valet parking. Free Wifi only in lobby, otherwise expensive. Starbucks coffee inside hotel. Nice wood-panelled bar but should get rid of those big flatscreen TV:s, it´s not really a sports bar. The Metro Station is very close by but we were surprised to have to wait 20 minutes Saturday 7.30 pm for a train at Gallery Place. The ride itself to Woodley Park (hotel) took only 6-7 minutes. In my opinion this is bad. New York Subway which we used for a week provided much better service."

Our Porter was especially helpful, even to the point of organising an extra rack for our large bags, and as always, such positive ""First Impressions"" matter.Our Room (on the top floor) was about average for this Hotel - adequate, but looking a bit ""tired"", but we noted our request as to preferred location had been accommodated.(By the way, as in some other U.S. hotels, they don't ""do"" shower-gel here - hard soap, yes - but we purchased a bottle at the CVS a short walking-distance away). We liked the facility included in our ""package"" to have an early-morning beverage delivered to the bedroom door, and we availed of that service for each morning of our seven day stay.On a previous visit, we were critical of the general attitude / service at Reception, and in fairness, we would have to say that this has improved considerably since we were last here.What seems to let this Hotel down is the Breakfast-time experience in the dining-room (""Robert's Restaurant""). Physically, it's a very attractive area, and the food offering is quite good, but service leaves a lot to be desired : our ""Greeter"" displayed little interest in the human race, never mind ""paying guests"", and service generally has 2 speeds, ""slow"" and ""very slow"". (We comment further on this in a separate review of ""Roberts Restaurant"").One of our favourite parts of this Hotel is ""The Marquee Lounge"". Here, the wise, charming and patient Hassan, courteously ensures that all customers are well looked after - even on nights when pushy patrons besiege the Bar. He is fortunate to be supported by an enthusiastic team, including the bubbly & extremely effective, Mimi.We were also impressed by the excellence of the Concierge service on this occasion. The Omni Shoreham seems to have found staff for this Desk who are ""switched-on"" to helping guests with wide-ranging (and possibly, not always readily solveable) queries. For us, the ""Star Performer"" here was Andre : he was patient, affable, helpful and imaginative, besides coming across as a truly ""nice guy"" - thanks, again Andre!In experiencing the services of a large busy hotel such as this, there's a risk that we overlook the contribution of the real ""Front-of-House"" people : Porters & Valets. Those that we met on arrival, during our stay, and when departing, were attentive & helpful, in some cases going that ""extra mile"".As you can gather, we value this Hotel, which is why we keep coming back. Our hope is that Omni Management will be able to address the shortcomings mentioned, such that the next time we're here, we'll be able to give it a 5* ""Excellent"" rating!"

All seemed extremely high. I remembered the Omni, checked the price and it was reasonable. The area where the hotel is has matured since we were there last(over 25 years ago). There are now many restaurants of various food types as well has the pizza, sandwich and breakfast places and pubs. The hotel is little over a block away from the Metro, which makes travelling around the city very easy. The Omni staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room we had was larger than most, quiet and very clean. The elevators worked well and never a long wait to get one to your floor. The valet service was quick, friendly.

Seems the staff often forgets to clean behind that door. Called and got a room change then waited for bellman to bring new key. 10 minutes later nobody showed up so I went to the front desk to get the key. Next room had it's own problems. There was a long hair on a lamp shade and a few in the bathroom and on the bed. The headboard for the bed had not been wiped for a while. I try to not cross the OCD line but these are standard cleaning issues I've found at many hotels. The wallpaper seams in my room are splitting in at least 8 places. The staff responded quickly and the front desk experience has been good. Other than the housekeeping issues the property is nice and I like the location. There good restaurants nearby (Mr. Chens!) as well as the Metro. This is a quiet area of town. I will post a follow up after my stay."

The rooms were on the large side and the beds very comfortable. Every person I came in contact with on the staff was very friendly and helpful. Oh, and I can't forget the huge outdoor pool...there are flags on the lounge chairs and when you put one up, someone will come to you and take your food order! They have a more than adequate fitness room, lovely locker rooms and spa. I don't want to go home!"

A friend recommended the Omni Shoreham and it was a lovely place to reside while touring the nation's capital. The rooms are spacious and perfect for a family of four. My son and daughter are too old to sleep in the same bed but not old enough to have a separate room. The mini suite has queen size beds (for my 6'3'' husband) and a sizable pull out sofa for one of the kids. Every night they delivered milk and gigantic chocolate chip cookies. My children loved the pool and it is shallow enough for even my youngest to play in comfortably. We dined at the hotel restaurant once but it was pricey so we took turns trying different eateries in the surrounding Adams-Morgan area. However, the breakfast buffet was excellent and ate that every morning. The coffee was strong (just how we like it), the selection was excellent and even the berries for the oatmeal were extremely fresh. The price is quite high but it fortified us for a morning of sight seeing. the subway is one block away but be warned: the escalator to get down to the platform is EXTREMELY steep, long and deep. I dreaded it everyday. Proper etiquette means to keep to the right as you stand on it as the left is used for regulars who walk down in a hurry. The attendants are quite helpful in learning how to pay for and navigate the system - don't be afraid to ask. It's the perfect location for the zoo which is free."

I think now it's time. My family and I stayed here for 4 days in April 2014 for our daughter's spring break. After seeing the hotel online we decided to book as the location was perfect for what we wanted to see and do. Everything seems ok and the hotel lobby was beautiful, but once check in came issues started. We are not that fussy so we let that go and carried on with our vacation. On day 2 we decided to order room service. My order was Chicken Quesadilla from the children's menu as nothing on the adult menu struck me. Once our orders arrived, we dug in as I had no reason to check my food. After the first bite I smelled what seem to be shrimp and I said to my husband this does not taste like chicken. It was then I inspected my food only to see Shrimp quesadilla looking back at me. I am DEATHLY ALLERGIC TO SHELL FISH. At that moment I ran to the bathroom and spit everything out, but it was too late I had already swallowed. My husband and daughter then took necessary actions. My husband contacted the in room dining and told them what happened. Their explanation to him, is they had no idea what happened as chicken quesadilla was put in as the order and they have no idea who shrimp was sent. At this point my husband decided that we have to get to the hospital. Thank god for my motherinlaw as she watched our daughter as my husband rushed me to the hospital no thanks to the hotel. One our way there my throat began to itch more and swell. The doctor that saw me even stated that as my Uvula was rather large. Treatment of steroids was given to me of which I had to take an intense dose for the rest of the week. The manager on staff at the time basically brushed my husband off once we returned and told him they are not equipped to handle such an emergency. No follow up call was made by the manager to check on my well being. At that point my husband was not too worried about that as my safety and life was more important to him. I did however got a call from in room dining to see if I was ok. The next day I sought out the manager on staff to let her know what had happened. She of course was shocked at what had transpired. After we had a discussion she decided to comp us for 2 nights stay. Once we got back home, I decided to send a certified letter with return signature to the President of Omni Hotels & Resorts Michael J. Deitemeyer. Lets just say I am still waiting on a response from him. I even went as far as filling out and online form, online to be contacted by in room dining basically telling me, we comp you 2 nights what else are you looking for. Omni Shoreham took no responsibility for their actions that almost cost me my life. It was swept under the rug and my family and I got brushed aside as though my life did not matter one bit to them. I guess I am not a dignitary as was pointed out to me by one of the front desk staff. OMNI SHOREHAM SHOULD BE ASHAMED.I am grateful to Ms. Burroughs for what she did and the staff at Georgetown University Hospital for taking care of me. Most of all I am forever grateful to my husband and our daughter for their heroics that saved my life. You guys are my hero. As for the hotel, the grounds were nice, lobby was nice and it is in a great location for sight seeing and also for eating. Basically you leave the lobby go through the front doors, make a right and walk out to the street and you are in food heaven. The room was basic, but clearly it is an old hotel and new windows and such is needed. The temperature dropped one night of our stay and lets just say the draft of cold coming through the window panes was so overwhelming that we shivered a bit."

Signed up for their program and they matched me well to the room preferences I indicated in my profile. The hotel has great history. Theoriginal design felt like I was in the set of the Shining, but in a good way, not spooky. It is clear that there have been renovations inside the property. Room was clean and the bathroom was well appointed. My favorite part of this property would have to be the outdoors. The pool and hot tub are open until 10pm. Gardens are wedding photo quality. Hammocks under the trees were always occupied but would have enjoyed them otherwise.I wasn't sure I would like the location at first, but it turned out to be very convenient. As others have pointed out, it's across the street to the train station and several places to eat/drink. Many places have happy hour and brunch specials. Adams Morgan is about 10 minutes walk with more options to eat/drink/shop. The zoo was an enjoyable ten minute walk also.I would definitely book again, especially in the summer months."

The Woodley Park-Zoo Metro Station was less than two short block away and will take you into the touristy part of DC in a matter of minutes.The hotel is located in a residential part of the city so you are away from the hustle and bustle you would expect if you were downtown. The hotel looks like a residential complex with the old fashion charm unlike the glass facade of today's newer hotels.I stayed on the top floor (8th) with a very comfy queen size bed. The room was clean and there was a refrigerator with complimentary water.There is a thermostat in the room so you control the temperature, cable tv was fine but it would have been nice if complimentary wifi would have been available in the room. If you sign-up to be a OMNI member then it would be free but I didn't want to bother. I just used the free wifi in the lobby.Overall I enjoyed my stay.

After reading TripAdvisor reviews we chose the Omni Shoreham. At $295 per night we assumed it would be just the right amount of poshness. Yes, the room was spacious and the bed linens divine. But there were other glitches that justify our rating.The bathroom wallpaper was torn in several places with damage to the drywall underneath quite evident (see our pictures captioned ""bathroom in poor condition""). The motion activated light in the closet was turned off and the switch was in the ceiling - quite the challenge for two 5'4"" senior citizens. Replenishment of the in-room coffee supplies was inconsistent. And the facial expression on the concierge was that of someone being annoyed by a gnat when we stopped to ask some questions.I would not stay here again; you can make up your own minds."

We booked though our travel agent who tailored are visit in USA. This hotel met our requirements on price and location. The location is great. Its slightly outside main area of DC however the Metro line is directly opposite hotel and a cab ride to the main area of DC is reasonable in price. We joined the loyalty program on advice from other reviews. This gives you preferences on room type etc. I had selected corner/end of corridor. Got that preferences I had chosen. Room was good size and clean and very comfortable. The hotel itself is quite Grand. We didn't have breakfast included so we ate across the road in Open City which was very tasty. Staff were friendly and helpful. Spent very little time in hotel actually, but if I were to return I would defiantly book here againThis hotel was absolutely gorgeous, however there were a few bumps with the service when we first checked in. I was traveling with my mother who has some problems with walking sometimes and when we were first directed to our room (which we were told was in the new addition/parkview) we were told it wasn't too far from the lobby - a total lie. We were given incorrect directions and had to stop twice to get help with where exactly our room was. By the time we arrived my mother was having a bit of issues with her knee and there was no way that we could stay that far from the lobby. The room also was pretty horrible. There were cobwebs in the bathroom, a broken light fixture, and dust everywhere in the room along with some sticky substance on the nightstand. I called the front desk right away and the man who answered was extremely helpful. He was able to get us assistance from bell services (which we were told wasn't available from the first front desk person), moved to a room a few floors right up from the lobby, and we moved right away. Both he and the bell services assistant saved the trip! The room was very nice, free wifi for joining the Omni rewards program was not super fast but just enough to get a bit of work done. The TV program guide was incorrect, and apparently so was our room service menu - according to the room service phone line we had an old menu that hasn't been replaced. The beds were comfortable, bathroom was just enough space, and the tub was insanely deep. It wasn't a garden tub but I'm sure if you wanted you could take a bath in it. Another issue we ran into was our key cards not working the same night we checked in. We called to maintenance the next morning (as it was pretty late when we realized that they weren't working) and were told that someone would be up to replace the battery soon. We left about an hour and a half or so after that call and no one had been by. When we returned back to our room much later in the day the door still hadn't been fixed. We had to call back down to the front desk and ask why - they stated that we had to be in the room for it to be fixed, something that hadn't been told to us earlier. They sent someone fairly quickly but it was still quite an inconvenience. Overall the hotel was quite nice and well appointed, however for the cost of the room I would probably choose to stay somewhere else next time considering the issues we ran into."

We purchased tickets through ""Things to do"" in D.C for the 2014 New Years Eve Gala. Which was a huge disappointment! We purchased V.I.P. tickets for $187 per person. I feel sorry for people who paid more. The events didn't start on time because the private event coordinators ( not affiliated with the Omni) let big groups of people go in ahead of everyone else that had been the first ones standing in line waiting to enter the event! These people promised a 4 course sit down white glove service dinner to those of us who had purchased V.I.P. tickets but instead we got a nasty self service cold buffet where food was placed on small sample dishes! Cheap champagne was served but the mixed drinks seemed to be fine and not watered down. They offered cartoon artist & photographers to draw and take your pictures which weren't free of charge which lead people to believe otherwise when purchasing tickets. They played horrible 80's music. Entertainment was terrible besides the one ballroom that had a live band playing. All in all I would never waste my money and purchase New Years Eve Gala tickets hosted at the Omni ever again! I will say that the Omni Shoreham does have very beautiful ballrooms and a lovely lobby. The rooms are a bit worn but clean. They do on the other hand have very thin paper walls! We kept hearing doors slam and the people next to us were very loud! We also had breakfast the following morning at the restaurant downstairs and was not impressed."

Great Stay!!,"We wanted to see Christmas lights in DC and that's exactly what we did. The lobby of the hotel was beautiful and full of Christmas decor --- poinsettias, toy soldiers, Santy Claus, fake snow, and Christmas trees. Down the street at the National Zoo, we enjoyed a nice walk through their Christmas lights, too.We rode the Metro train from the airport to the hotel. (Quick enough ride and the train stop is very close to the hotel.)The front desk clerk was friendly and asked if we had any special room requests. (The hotel didn't seem busy, but I noticed just about each evening there was a new load of guests checking in.) We requested a room with a nice view. She gave us a room over looking the garden with a gazebo, but the view was partially obstructed by the roof of a room (ballroom or restaurant) below. We were still happy not to have to face the huge apartment/ condo across the street from the hotel.The room was nicely appointed, spacious, and comfy. There's a short hallway that gives you access to the bedroom, a closet, and bathroom. The bathroom is rather small, but clean. The bed linens were cozy and there were two bathrobes waiting for us in the closet.I agree with other reviewers that there are acoustic issues and noises from the pipes. If you're a late riser who's sensitive to sound, you may need to think twice about staying here. (I only heard sounds in the morning.) However, if you like a cozy, clean, nicely decorated hotel room that makes you feel as if you are a guest in someone's home, this is the place for you!I had no bad experiences with any of the staff. Everyone was actually friendly, helpful, and personable. (And I'm NOT an Omni loyalty member.)BTW, I didn't see a ghost. I wouldn't have left if I did anyway. I enjoyed my stay too well. And check out the pizza from the Italian Pizza Kitchen or some delicious chicken wings from Hot n Juicy's Crawfish restaurant on Conneticut Ave (very short walking distance from the hotel)."

Ultimately we had a very good stay here.Good stuff:* If you find the right room, this place rocks. We spent 4 nights in 697, which which extremely private, quiet and spacious.* The staff is excellent (front desk, valet, room service.)* The rooms were nice, considering the age. (See photos.)* The lobby feels ""alive."" There were several events going on, the restaurants were busy, etc. This is a good sign considering how deep into off-season we were.* The neighborhood was really nice and safe. We took several walks in the area.* The price was right. Shop GHA and Omni flash sales for good last-minute prices.Bad stuff:* The first room we had (in the middle of the hotel) was noisy. Really noisy. If you get this sort of thing, ask to be moved, because habituation doesn't improve your mood.* Our light in the closet of the first room randomly turned on and off when the door was closed. Google auto-complete reveals that there is some haunting mystique to this hotel (for the Ghost suite only), but our first room had the same symptom. Boo!Overall, I'd totally stay here again."

This Omni is an elegant, old business hotel. The shoddy rooms and poor cleaning was a huge disappointment. The wallpaper in the room was pealing and there were stains in the bathroom a crud on the light switch. Yuck!"

Very comfortable room, nice size (king-bed), with a small marble bathroom, walk-in closet, and a connecting door to a neighboring room (not that we used or needed it during our stay). Only 1 block from the Metro, which we ended up not using after all. Nice choice of restaurants close by - ate at Open City right across the street for dinner, and went to Woodley Cafe around the corner on Connecticut Avenue for brunch the following morning for brunch. Enjoyed the National Zoo for the afternoon, which is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. Located right by Rock Creek Park, which is a bonus.Was glad to have found the coffee-maker, which I initially thought the room didn't have, and found strange for such an upscale hotel, but found it in the dresser cabinet under the TV. Nice options of Wolfgang Puck coffees and Tazo teas.Cons: Valet parking was expensive ($35 plus tax = $41+), and the only option - it took hours to get something left behind in the car in error after it was moved to the parking lot. Would be ideal to have the option of self-parking, and only valet parking if/when self-parking section is full. The bathroom was bordering on too small, as you have to stand to the side behind the door to be able to close it. Also, the hallways were noisy, due to inconsiderate hotel guests not keeping quiet in the early hours of the morning (some were coming from the wedding that happened that night, which finished up at 2am) - not the fault of the hotel for noisy guests, but would/could be an improvement if there were ways to soundproof the rooms. Didn't eat at the hotel, or use the pool or gym, so cannot vouch for that side of the hotel.Overall, would definitely stay here again, if I'm lucky enough to find the excellent price I was able to get for this trip."

We has a great room with an excellent view. And, the hotel is conveniently located to a D.C. Metro Station, as well as several nearby eateries. In addition, you can walk to the National Zoo. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. The staff here is of high caliber and I commend them on their level of customer service. Thank you!! You made our stay in D.C. very pleasant and enjoyable."

The staff was effecient, the room (a standard king) was spacious the well appointed.All in all, a great place to stay, particularly with the price we got, around $185 with taxes."

We were looking forward to our stay, thanks to the many reviews I poured over on this site. The hotel is quite beautiful & historic, a perfect blend for a vacation in Washington. I made our reservation through travelocity & got a great rate. I did sign up for the Omni stay/rewards club, which is free, just go to their site. It gave us some free perks like a couple cups of coffee & newspaper delivered each morning, 2 bottles of water in our frig upon arrival, and there are other advantages, so check it out. We did order room service for breakfast, just toast/pastry, & the croissants are enormous. Our room was awesome, spotless upon arrival & kept that way throughout our stay by the staff. It was a corner room on the 6th floor, noise not a problem. The room is huge, and had a small balcony. The in-room safe easily stored my larger laptop as well as other items. We did not try the dining there, as there were so many choices in the city. The outdoor pool is beautiful & was also very clean & in great condition. The valet parking was about $42 per day with tax, which is not unusual in that town. Whenvever we called for the car, porter, anything, the service was extremely prompt, usually less than 5 minutes. Everyone on staff was very gracious and helpful, I really can't say enough about the superior customer service. We had one problem, a stopped toilet on the 2nd day. My husband called, we went up the street for some shopping, problem resolved when we returned. One of the major reasons I chose this hotel was because of it's close proximety to the Metro, maybe a five minute walk. We went everywhere on the Metro or buses. Awesome & fast. The area is very nice, trendy, eclectic area. Open City restaurant had some great dishes, we ate dinner there twice. The food was very good, priced nicely. Also had Baskin-Robbins ice cream everyday, but hey, it is vacation! We would definately stay here again if we return to DC. It is a great hotel."

My husband and I are military, let me just say they treated us like we were on our honeymoon.. Our room was $120 per night. We stayed for 2 nights and our final bill was around $355. The parking was $35 a night which is expensive but that is DC. Dc tax period is expensive as well..The bridal suite room 740 has a wonderful garden view and you can also see the Washington monument. We had a big patio walkway. The bed was comfy so were the blankets and pillows. Room was clean. Loved the huge tub! To me the hotel was just gorgeous. It has that old classy victorian look. Simply beautiful I must say. The pool seemed a bit small for such a big hotel but it could have just been that it was crowded too. We did not order any room service because it was a bit pricey. Same for the restaurant I did not try it therefore I can not review it. Parking as I mentioned is 35 for overnight. This is very expensive to me since Im not used to paying for parking. The valet guys still expect a tip which I didn't do since I paid 35 per night already. Within walking distance there is a CVS, hot n juicy crawfish rest, sushi, meditterran food, and etc. We took a cab from the hotel to the Lincoln monument which was about $14. We went there on the 50 yr anniversary of Martin Luther Kings Freedom Speech so it was a mad house near all the memorials. Overall I would stay here again if I had the chance and I highly recommend this beautiful hotel."

The staff are wonderful, the hotel itself absolutely gorgeous (reminded us of the Overlook in the Shining, for you Stephen King fans!) and we really enjoyed our stay. Our room was spacious and very clean, and we enjoyed the friendly nature of the staff.It is conveniently located, very close to many restaurants and supermarkets about a 5 minute walk away. In addition, there is a wonderful Zoo that we walked to from the hotel, all free entry!Access to the subway is also excellent, with the nearest station again about a 5 minute walk away.We absolutely loved our stay here and would love to come back again!"

Every staff member we interacted with were super friendly and helpful. The hotel was built around 1930 and they have done a great job of preserving the elegance and historical aspects. Beautiful carpet, chandeliers and glass door knobs preserve its character. Our room was spacious and very clean. The pool is perfect size for relaxing or unwinding after a long day,and also has a kiddie pool and hot tub. The breakfast buffet was of incredible quality. Omlette/waffle station as well as hot and cold options, even gluten free choices. Room service was great too! The hotel is 4 blocks from the zoo and only one block from a subway so it it convenient to go downtown or into Georgetown. We took advantage of a ""pool special"" they offerred on their website, which included breakfast and valet parking for our stay."

We were blown away when we arrived at this stunning hotel. The front foyer is really a sight, and the hotel has done a beautiful job of keeping it elegant and welcoming. Big plush chairs, sparkling chandeliers, and exquisite marble on the floors make you feel like you're royalty (or a high-ranking politician!) As a history-lover, I appreciated that the hotel has put up banners on four of its pillars which tell of significant moments in the hotel's history. Everything from inauguration balls, to movie scenes shot in the hotel are featured on these posts, and they are so interesting! Did you know the Beatles stayed here and had a whole wing to themselves? There is also the hand-written (by John Lennon!) set list framed in a glass-window on the way to the West elevators! Very cool. We stayed in a suite, which was superb, although it needed more plugs, more artwork/mirrors, and more comfortable chairs in front of the TV. The walls that the TVs were on were quite bare (one in livingroom, one in bedroom), and the wall over the desk didn't have any artwork or a mirror (it needs it). The hallway from the door to the livingroom needs some artwork too, and perhaps a little table over the plug in the floor so you aren't charging things on the floor, and you have somewhere consistent to put hotel room keys.... I realize this is picky but it just seemed a little ""bare bones"". The beds were comfortable (bouncy), and there are these great little LED lights on the headboards that allow you to read while your ""bed partner"" sleeps in the dark! The air conditioner did a good job of keeping the room cool, but it was quite loud when it kicked in. We had a balcony looking over the pool, but being on the 8th floor we did not have any noise from the air conditioners on the roof of the lower floor, or any noise from the pool (except for a few screams from kids here and there, no big deal). We used the internet/wifi and it was a bit.... finicky. Hard to connect to on my ipad, and not very fast, although on another device it wasn't too bad, once connected. You could tell that the room was old, but had been updated. We had a nice cold fridge, coffee maker, and a hairdryer in the room (and it's a plug in, not wall-mounted, so it's not necessary to pack/bring your own!)We had the breakfast buffet one morning and it was $21 EACH! It is NOT WORTH IT and the food isn't that great. People line up to get in, though, so resist the temptation to follow the crowd and grab breakfast at the Open Cafe across the street (kitty-corner) from the hotel. The Omni is located just down the street from the Metro stop of Woodley Park/Zoo and features probably the tallest/longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere. There are also INCREDIBLE restaurants nearby (and yes, a McDonalds for the kids...) as well as a CVS drugstore and bank machine close by. On the corner of Connecticut and Calvert both the Big Bus (double decker) and Old Town Trolley Tour buses have a stop -- same stop, two different companies. The Omni is also located in one of the most beautiful residential areas, with incredible big houses. It's a safe and lovely hotel to stay in and I would recommend it if you can afford it!"

By calling the hotel reservations directly, I got an amazing deal on a Jr. Suite, 711 sf of comfortable luxury for our family of 5. More like an apartment than a hotel room, we had a dining room, living room complete with our very own ""oval office"" (a curved back wall with a desk, overlooking the park - and some building rooftop), entryway and hall, huge bedroom with two double beds, walk-in closet and bathroom, all in a stately decor fitting of our Nation's Capital. We even had a private balcony where we caught a thunderstorm. The large living space turned our great to host many friends we were visiting in the area, but the hotel amenities also kept us comfortable. As a major conference location, there are many conveniences, including a nice lounge for drinks. It's also surprisingly family friendly with a fun outdoor pool. While all the staff was exceptional, the Concierge desk really stood out, directing us to a great place to order pizza in room as well as dine out and tour the city with great charm and a huge smile. The Robert's Restaurant looked too fancy for kids, so we waited until the last day to have brunch there which was so delicious and comfortable I regretted not doing it every day! The hotel itself has a great history which is fun to explore - it's hosted many inaugural balls for example. We were worried we would regret being out of downtown, but we walked to the zoo, and many restaurants. A CVS drugstore is also a block away. The neighborhood is safe, the surrounding park pretty, and you can catch public transport right across the street - either the Metro or the two largest tourist bus operations. In the end, I had to promise my kids (and myself) we could come back and stay there again. Three nights was not long enough to enjoy all the area had to offer, and the Omni Shoreham certainly made the idea of a longer stay very enticing. Overall, our expectations were far exceeded.The lobby is splendid and luxurious, rich in history. The concierge is very helpful and knowledgeable. The room was correct, nothing exceptional - the rate was totally acceptable. Good location, close to restaurants, zoo and metro station."
